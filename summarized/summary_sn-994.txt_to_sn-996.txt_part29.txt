SHOW TEASE:  It's time for Security Now!.  Steve Gibson is here.  The full story about the remote code execution on Linux he talked about last week.  We now know what it was.  It's not as serious as it seemed, but it could potentially be a problem for a lot of people.  What social media platform is now in Roskomnadzor's crosshairs?  We'll tell you.  You should update VLC.  There's a big flaw in it.  And Steve takes a closer look at the security in Recall, and the things Microsoft has done to make it safer.  Can you put lipstick on a pig?  Maybe you can, next on Security Now!.



LEO LAPORTE:  This is Security Now! with Steve Gibson, Episode 994, recorded Tuesday, October 1st, 2024:  Recall's Re-Rollout.



It's time for Security Now!, the show where we cover your security, your privacy, your science fiction reading online with this guy right here, Mr. Steve Gibson of GRC.com.



STEVE GIBSON:  And Leo, we actually do have actually a little bit of sci-fi from John Slanina.



LEO:  JammerB.



STEVE:  Famously known as JammerB.



LEO:  JammerB.  You know, JammerB of course was our studio manager, has since retired.  And I know he's watching right now.  I have a little JammerB corner in the studio.  The very first time I met him he brought me that telephone, you know, the one with the "Hello, Central, give me..." you know, the thing you hold to your ear.



And then the last time I saw him he gave me the Macintosh, the original Mac 128K, and he had set it up so it would run.  And he texted us and said, "If Leo runs Load Runner in the background, it's got a great active screen."  It's actually playing Load Runner right behind you.  So John is, even though he's not in the studio, he is memorialized in the hardware behind me.  He's also memorialized in one other way.  I have him saying "Hey."



CLIP:  Hey, hey.



LEO:  Because he used to, anytime somebody swore, I don't think it happened on this show very often, but he would get all upset.  So he recorded this for me.



CLIP:  Hey, hey.



STEVE:  Your own personal FCC.



LEO:  Yeah.  Hey.



STEVE:  Hey.



LEO:  What's coming up this week on Security Now!?



STEVE:  We have the full story about the Linux remote code execution flaw.



LEO:  Oh, good.



STEVE:  Which we previewed with some unknowns and questions and just a little skepticism.  But, you know, why was there controversy?  We're going to find out.  We're going to look at what bad stuff can happen if a domain escapes one's control even briefly.  What social media platform is now in Russia's Roskomnadzor crosshairs?  The need to update VLC, the very popular VideoLAN media player.



LEO:  Oh, I use that.



STEVE:  To resolve a potential remote code execution flaw there.



LEO:  Okay.



STEVE:  Tor and Tails have some news.  Telegram has some news.  Also we've got some interesting info from Bobiverse's author; and, as I mentioned, some feedback about Peter Hamilton's latest novel from none other than JammerB.  Also a listener provided some information I didn't know I needed until he offered it, about getting Windows to stop re-asking to set up an already setup system.  It's like, what?  I already went through this before.



LEO:  Yes.



STEVE:  Anyway, turns out you can turn that off.  And Microsoft is re-rolling out Recall.  Have they actually addressed the valid concerns, or is this just more lipstick on a pig?  Today's episode is Recall's Re-Rollout for October 1st.



LEO:  Once a pig, always a pig.



STEVE:  Always, yeah, that's right.



LEO:  Not much you can do to make it less of a pig, but we'll see, we'll see.



STEVE:  I'm not suggesting anyone that listens to this podcast is going to be excited, but we're going to take a look at it and see how much they should be forgiven for what they first tried to foist off on the industry.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  And, oh, we've got a great Picture of the Week.



LEO:  I only see the title.  I haven't seen the picture.  It's in front of me.  We'll see it together, shall we, in just a moment.



STEVE:  That sounds good. 



LEO:  Yeah.  Except for those of you who cheat and download the show notes ahead of time, which you can get at GRC.com.



STEVE:  Actually, the mailing to all of our listeners went out last night.  This is the first time in 19-plus years that I had the podcast, like, actually finished on Tuesday.



LEO:  Did you have a hot date or something?



STEVE:  I just started early, and everything kind of came together.



LEO:  Okay.



STEVE:  So, yeah, those people who have chosen to sign up for the Security Now! mailing list got - in fact, one person wrote back and said, hey, this is great, I can read it, so I'll have an idea what you guys are talking about tomorrow.



LEO:  Prepare for the show the night before, that's a good idea.



STEVE:  Do your homework, that's right.



LEO:  Well, and we are sitting here in Petaluma, California, rapidly approaching 100 degrees.  It's 96.  And I have a - I will ring this bell when we get to 100.



STEVE:  Oh, good.



LEO:  Just some old-fashioned radio fun; okay?  All right, Steve.  I am ready.  I am going to scroll up on the Picture of the Week, and we will look at it together.  Are you ready?  [Fanfare]  "Electrician Wanted."  I don't get it, but it's funny.



STEVE:  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.



LEO:  Oh, there's more.  "Experience required this time."  Okay.  Maybe you'd better describe.  That is pretty good.  The caption makes it, Steve.



STEVE:  Yeah.  So, okay.  So what we have is a green wall, and inset is some sort of an electrical, presumably high-tension wiring situation.  The doors...



LEO:  You can see the wires hanging out there.



STEVE:  Yeah, the wires are clear, and the door's been left ajar, apparently as a consequence of what recently happened.  Now, imagine - it really is good - if somebody was wearing hard-soled shoes, and they exploded.  Well, the shoes, the soles of the shoes would keep the ground at its original color where they were.  But you'd get this singed look like everywhere around.



LEO:  Basically, the guy exploded in a puff of greasy black smoke, and that's all that's left.  Holy cow.



STEVE:  So, yes, they're looking for a new electrician because we can see what happened to the last one.



LEO:  Not good.



STEVE:  And they're saying, you know, make sure you know what you're doing because, you know.  And believe me, if you walked up to this panel, looking down and seeing the remainder of this guy's shoes, the previous electrician, you'd be very careful with which wires you touched.



LEO:  Very nice.  I like it.  Well done, Steve.



STEVE:  Hey, thanks to our listeners.  They're out scouring the Internet, finding these goodies.  And in some cases, you know, they're like walking past something, go ooh, this would be a perfect picture for Security Now!.



LEO:  Always be thinking.



STEVE:  And they take the pictures themselves and send them in.



LEO:  Yup, always be thinking Picture of the Week.



STEVE:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  So we have news of that somewhat controversial, unauthenticated, meaning you don't have to log in or do anything, Linux remote code execution vulnerability which we discussed last week.  Simone Margaritelli began his widely anticipated and still clearly annoyed expos, which he posted late last week, by writing:  "Hello, friends.  This is the first of two, possibly three (if and when I have time to finish the Windows research) write-ups.  We'll start with targeting GNU/Linux systems with an RCE."  And we know that's Remote Code Execution.  "As someone who's directly involved in the CUPS [C-U-P-S] project said:  'From a generic security point of view, a whole Linux system as it is nowadays is just an endless and hopeless mess of security holes waiting to be exploited.'"



He ends the quote, and he says:  "Well they're not wrong.  While this is not the first time I try to more or less responsibly report a vulnerability, it is definitely the weirdest and most frustrating time as some of you might have noticed from my socials, and it is also the last time.  More on that later, but first."



Okay, so first, to interrupt him for a minute, that acronym "CUPS" is the abbreviation for the Common Unix Printing System.  It's a modular printing subsystem for Unix-like computer systems, including Linux.  So the Hacker News reported on what Simone Margaritelli revealed by writing as following.  They said:  "A new set of security vulnerabilities has been disclosed in the OpenPrinting Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) on Linux systems that could permit remote command execution under certain conditions.  Security researcher Simone Margaritelli said:  'A remote unauthenticated attacker can silently replace existing printers' (or install new ones) IPP URLS with a malicious one, resulting in arbitrary command execution (on the computer) when a print job is started (from that computer).'"



So Hacker News said:  "CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, including Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, ChromeOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, openSUSE, and SUSE Linux."



LEO:  I think CUPS is also used on macOS.



STEVE:  Oh, yes, right.



LEO:  Yeah, yeah.



STEVE:  "Simone identified four vulnerabilities," they wrote, "which have received CVE designations.  A net consequence of these shortcomings is that they could be fashioned into an exploit chain that allows an attacker to create a malicious, fake printing device on a network-exposed Linux system running CUPS and trigger remote code execution upon sending a print job.



"Network security company Ontinue said:  'The issue arises due to improper handling of "New Printer Available" announcements in the "CUPS-browsed" component' - which is a service, as we'll see here in a minute - 'combined,' they wrote, 'with poor validation by CUPS of the information provided by a malicious printing resource.  The vulnerability stems from inadequate validation of network data, allowing attackers to get the vulnerable system to install a malicious printer driver, and then send a print job to that driver triggering execution of the malicious code.  The malicious code is executed with the privileges of the printing user - not the superuser "root."'



"Red Hat Enterprise Linux, in an advisory, said all versions of the operating system are affected by the four flaws, but noted that they're not vulnerable in their default configuration.  It tagged the issues as Important in severity, given that the real-world impact is likely to be low.  Red Hat writes:  'By chaining this group of vulnerabilities together, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution which could then lead to theft of sensitive data and/or damage to critical production systems.'"  And I would argue, if you're installing a malicious driver, it can probably do worse than that.  But, you know, that's Red Hat wanting to sort of tamp this down a little bit.  And there was arguably, you know, it had some need of some tamping.



"Cybersecurity firm Rapid7 pointed out that affected systems are exploitable, either from the public Internet or across network segments, only if UDP port 631 is accessible, and the vulnerable service is listening.  Palo Alto Networks has disclosed that none of its products and cloud services contain the aforementioned CUPS-related software packages, and therefore are not impacted by the flaws.  Patches for the vulnerabilities are currently being developed and are expected to be released in the coming days.  Until then, it's advisable to disable and remove the CUPS-browsed service if it's not necessary, and block or restrict traffic to UDP port 631.



"Benjamin Harris, CEO of watchTowr, said in a statement shared with the Hacker News:  'It looks like the embargoed Linux unauth RCE vulnerabilities that have been touted as doomsday for Linux systems may only affect a subset of systems.  Given this, while the vulnerabilities in terms of technical impact are serious, it is significantly less likely that desktop machines and workstations running CUPS are exposed to the Internet in the same manner or numbers that typical server editions of Linux would be.'



"Satnam Narang, senior staff engineer at Tenable, said these vulnerabilities are not at a level of a Log4Shell or Heartbleed.  He said:  'The reality is that across a variety of software, be it open or closed source, there are a countless number of vulnerabilities that have yet to be discovered and disclosed.'"







LEO:  Oh, well that's okay, then.



STEVE:  And that's why we're not ending at 999, folks.  Countless.  We could count our episodes, but we cannot count the vulnerabilities



LEO:  Amazing.



STEVE:  He said:  "Security research is vital to this process, and we can and should demand better of software vendors."  Oh, also:  "For organizations that are honing in on these latest vulnerabilities, it's important to highlight that the flaws that are most impactful and concerning are the known vulnerabilities that continue to be exploited by advanced persistent threat groups with ties to nation states, as well as ransom affiliates that are pilfering corporations for millions of dollars each year."  So, you know, that's Tenable's stance on this.



Okay.  So this is sort of what we expected; right?  If it was a four-alarm fire emergency, there wouldn't have been that controversy surrounding it that was evident when we talked about this last week.  In this instance, yes, there are problems.  And, yes, they need fixing.  But we've seen plenty of CVSS 9.8s, and this collection doesn't rank up there with those.  And for his part, Simone still seems, you know, to be smarting over the backlash from his trying to get everyone's attention when he didn't feel that developers were taking it seriously enough.



At the end of Part 1, which is what I shared the beginning of, of his detailed write up - and I skipped that because it's just detail, and I've got a link to it in the show notes for anyone who wants it.  Anyway, he summed up Part 1 by writing:  "You will maybe be thinking now, 'Wow, that's a lot of stuff to read, code, RFCs, PDFs of forgotten standards, this research must have been so tiring.'"  He said:  "But in reality this was a weekend worth of rabbit holes.  This was the fun part.  The actual work, the heavy, boring stuff started when, on September 5th, after confirming my findings, I decided to open a security advisory on the OpenPrinting CUPS-browsed repository and do what to me was the right thing to do:  responsible disclosure.



"I won't go into the details of the initial conversation, or the ones that followed.  You're free to read them (if they will ever open any of the threads, and you're willing to read 50-plus pages of conversation) or not, and make your own opinion.  While the research only took a couple of days, this part took 22.  And this part was not fun. I will only say that to my personal experience, the responsible disclosure process is broken.  That a lot is expected and taken for granted from the security researchers by triagers that behave like you have to 'prove to be worth listening to' while in reality they barely care to process and understand what you're saying, only to realize you were right all along three weeks later, if ever.



"Two days for the research, 249 lines of text for the fully working exploit.  Twenty-two days of arguments, condescension, several gaslighting attempts," he said, "(the things I've read these days, you have no idea), more or less subtle personal attacks, dozens of emails and messages, more than 100 pages of text in total.  Hours and hours and hours and hours and effing hours.  Not to mention somehow being judged by a big chunk of the infosec community with a tendency of talking and judging situations they simply don't know.  Let that sink in for a moment.  What the actual F.



"And we're not talking about time spent on fixes while I was impatient and throwing a tantrum on Twitter.  The actual fixes (or part of them) started being pushed much later.  The vast majority of the time has been spent arguing whether or not these were issues worth considering.  While I was trying to report that there's something bad that should be addressed ASAP, the devs were being dismissive (and pushing other code, also vulnerable, for other functionalities instead of fixing) because I dared to criticize the design of their software.  While at the same time I was trying to reach out privately to de-escalate and assure whoever was getting offended that my intent was not adversarial.



"To the people that more or less directly questioned my integrity, accused me of spectacularization and of spreading FUD on my socials:  I don't do this for a living.  I don't need CVEs to get a job, or to prove how good my kung-fu is.  Or any attention other than what my projects and research already provide.  I don't play InfoSec Influencer like many.  My mission was to interrupt the triagers' focus until they re-prioritized.  When I saw what I thought was pretty serious was being dismissed as an annoyance, I used the only platform I had plus a pinch of drama as a tool to have them effing re-prioritize.  And it worked wonderfully.  More fixes happened after two weeks than with all the arguing and talking before.  So don't hate me, hate the system that forced me to do that in order to be taken seriously."



And you know, Leo, he's got a point.  You know, I mean, we've talked about the downside of the whole open source environment is that it's all volunteers.



LEO:  Right.



STEVE:  Right?  Mostly volunteers.  There are, you know, like Red Hat is able to employ people professionally to maintain and manage things.  But there are people who are busy.  If in fact there's the load of defects that, I mean, Linux apparently has them just as much as Windows does, that need to get fixed, then it is a matter of priority.



LEO:  There is triage.  There has to be.



STEVE:  Yes, exactly.  And, Leo, you can imagine how many less-qualified individuals are in fact reporting specious things that are actually not problems. 



LEO:  Right, right, right.



STEVE:  In fact, that's why last week I went to dig into who this guy was, and we saw that, okay, you know...



LEO:  He's legit.



STEVE:  ...he's got some cred behind him.  He's been active for a decade and is responsible for finding lots of problems.  So he's not nuts.  But they don't know that when they're busy, you know, dealing with a lot of reports that probably are less credible.  So, you know, his position I think is understandable.



Our takeaway is that some unlikely to be exploitable yet important flaws were indeed found, and they will be fixed in future editions of Linux and BSD code, in their common CUPS subsystems.  So Simone did a good thing, and the open source ecosystem is better today for his willingness to push, even though those who were pushed did not appreciate being pushed.  Because I'm sure that other people were reading his social media postings and then saying to the devs, hey, what about this?  Is this really so bad?  So, you know, he used what influence he had in order to try to make them do what he wanted to.



LEO:  He's a little annoying.



STEVE:  Yes.  Nobody appreciates having that done to them.



LEO:  And some of that is, you know, yes, nobody appreciates that.  Unfortunately, people who are attracted to this business often lack certain social skills, shall we say.  And he sounds like exactly the kind of nerd, geek, that we run into all the time who's very literal, really takes it seriously, and doesn't know how to apply social grease.  A little social grease would have gone a long way here, perhaps.  Is it as bad as he's painting it?



STEVE:  Okay.  So maybe.  Reports are that there are more than 100,000 instances of that particular vulnerable surface exposed on the public Internet.



LEO:  Yeah, because I have CUPS on all of my machines, including the Macs.



STEVE:  Yes, but...



LEO:  But I don't have the browser installed; right?  Is that the key?



STEVE:  Well, even if you did, and there are - I think it's Linux Mint does have it running by default.  So there are Linuxes that have it running by default.



LEO:  Oh.



STEVE:  But you're behind a NAT router.  Anybody in a home network behind NAT is going to be safe because it's not going to...



LEO:  It's not routable.



STEVE:  ...that UDP port 631 will not be publically exposed.  Okay.  So a really nice summary of this was just posted in Risky Business News, which summarized this.  And they add a bit of additional interesting details.  They wrote:  "Threat actors are scanning the Internet for UNIX systems that are exposing their printing ports in an attempt to exploit a set of four vulnerabilities in the CUPS printing component.  The vulnerabilities were discovered by Italian security researcher Simone Margaritelli earlier this year and were disclosed at the end of last week.  They impact CUPS, the Common UNIX Printing System, an open-source component to allow UNIX systems to function as print servers.



"The four bugs are part of an exploit chain that can allow an attacker to deploy a malicious printer, having the printer indexed by a victim's CUPS server, plant malicious code on the CUPS server inside a PPD file, and have the malicious code from the PPD file executed when a user launches a print job via the attacker's malicious printer.  The exploit chain is, in this order:  CVE-2024-47176, -47076, -47175, and -47177.



"Besides Margaritelli's write-up explaining how the four bugs work, other analyses on the four are also available, which suggests the credibility of this, via Akamai, Rapid7, Elastic, Tenable, Qualys, Datadog, and AquaSec.  The bugs received a lot of attention and were extremely over-hyped over the past week after Margaritelli posted about them on Twitter before patches were released.  Let's just say" - and this is Risky Business News writing.  "Let's just say they're not as bad as they were made out to be.  They don't impact all Linux distros - only a few, actually.  They're only exploitable within very limited scenarios, and the 9.9 CVSS score should have been lower.  Yes, they're bad bugs that are easy to exploit, but they're not the Linux world-ending kind, like Heartbleed, for example.



"But regardless of their severity and all the weird conditions needed to exploit the bugs, threat actors don't care.  After Margaritelli and others published proof-of-concept code at the end of last week, threat actors began scanning the Internet for UDP port 631, which is the port..."



LEO:  And they use Shodan and things like that to do that; right?



STEVE:  Yes.



LEO:  Okay.



STEVE:  Well, and their own scanners.



LEO:  And they can run a scanner, sure.



STEVE:  Our guy Marcus Hutchins was the one, he posted that he scanned the 'Net himself and found over 100,000 instances.



LEO:  Yeah, you could use Nmap or something like that, too.



STEVE:  Exactly.  Yeah, and there are now high-speed scanners that do parallel scanning en masse.



LEO:  Signing that, yeah.



STEVE:  So they wrote:  "If this port is exposed on the Internet, then bad things are going to happen to your CUPS server in the coming days."  And they finished:  "Even if CUPS ships disabled by default on most distros, according to Shodan, there are currently over," and they quoted, "75,000 systems running CUPS exposed over the Internet, which is quite an attractive piece of pie if you're an attacker.  Other scans have these numbers at over 107,000, but they could be even bigger than this.  Mitigating the vulnerability should be pretty easy.  Just disable, remove, or update CUPS.  You should not be running that anyway," they said.



LEO:  Okay.  Interesting.  Yeah, he seemed a little whiny.  And publishing a proof of concept so early is also problematic; right?



STEVE:  Yes.  I would argue, yes, that the patches are not out yet.  They're still happening.  And as a result of him jumping up and down and screaming, it brought a lot of attention to this.  And proof of concepts are immediately deployable by people who are scanning.  So unfortunately, the upshot of this is that people will get hurt, given that those are true instances of CUPS which are exposed on port UDP 631.  As we know, there's a lot of port reuse on the Internet.  So it could be some other type of service that is listening or, you know, who knows what.



But still, likely a bunch of systems are going to be hurt.  And that's unfortunate.  You know, that is a sad consequence of the way we're doing things now.  But it's also foreseeable; right?  I mean, you know, some guy, as you said, who is impatient and clearly pissed off about the way he feels he was treated by the devs, not escalating this to the degree he wanted it escalated.  Then, you know, let's loose too soon, and the result is not what he would have chosen in the beginning.



LEO:  This is a big problem in open source is that we have a lot of people with limited social skills for a variety of reasons.  Some of them are neurodivergent; some of them are just jerks.  And we all have to work together.  And not everybody's good at working together.  



STEVE:  Well, Leo, it's a microcosm of the Internet.  



LEO:  Yes, we're humans.



STEVE:  You know, where don't you find that on the Internet?



LEO:  Exactly.  Good point.



STEVE:  You know, it's just humanity.



LEO:  Yeah.  Software requires an unusual amount of collaboration, especially open source software.  More than we're maybe all used to.



STEVE:  And it really does require check your ego at the door.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  I mean, one of the things that I have found that's worked best for me is like just putting the software out there and asking the people, as has happened over in GRC's newsgroups, find my problems.  Find the things I screwed up.  Find the things that I didn't get right.  You know, I know how to use it, so it works for me.  And, you know, sure enough, these guys are wonderful about finding stuff that I didn't get right.  And I don't care.  I mean, all I want to do is have the result be the best it possibly can be.  My ego is way down the list of things that I'm concerned about.  I just want to be able to offer the best software I can.



LEO:  And as Keira points out in our Discord, it's not just Simone's ego that might have gotten in the way.  There might have been some other egos, too.



STEVE:  Yeah.  Well, again, the devs are, you know, it's probably difficult for us to imagine how busy they are and the fact that there are probably many other people saying that they found this or that wrong which just isn't.  



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  And in fact, in the early days of working on SpinRite, I would have gone insane if I didn't have GitLab just to hold all the stuff, all the reports coming in.  And I'd just take a deep breath and just go to the next one and take a look at it, see if I could recreate it.  Often it's like, oh, cool, someone found something, and I would fix it.  Sometimes I just couldn't ever make it happen.  And so we'd wait to see if anybody else could.  So, I mean, it really is a process.



LEO:  Yeah.  And imagine what it was like before we had Git.



STEVE:  Oh.



LEO:  And there are still open source projects who use email for their pull requests and things like that.  And that's hard.  That's really not ideal.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  Do you want to take a break now, or do you want to keep going?



STEVE:  Let's take a break.  It's a perfect time.  And then we're going to talk about what happens if an enterprise briefly loses control of its domain.



LEO:  Oh, that's not good.  I can see it.



STEVE:  Turns out it's worse than you would think.



LEO:  Not good. 



STEVE:  No.  So the news last week was that Ether.fi, a so-called DeFi, as we're calling it now, a Decentralized Finance Platform, was the target of a DNS hijack after threat actors took control of its Gandi account.  So Gandi is their domain registrar.  On September 24th, by abusing Gandi.net's account recovery mechanisms - and there's no clear detail on exactly how that was done - bad guys managed to switch Ether.fi's registered nameservers over to those that they controlled.



LEO:  Ooh, that's not good.



STEVE:  That's not good.  Since Ether.fi received account recovery notification, within three hours the changes had been reverted, and Ether.fi's account had been successfully locked to further prevent tampering.  Now, what I found interesting was that in this reporting everyone appears to be breathing a sigh of relief.  But a lot can be done...



LEO:  Three hours.  Three hours.



STEVE:  Yes, immediately upon the takeover of a domain.  For example, valid web server domain certificates can be immediately obtained from any registrar, from any certificate authority, rather, since proof of domain control is all that's required.  And due to the fact that, as we well know, certificate revocation is a myth, those certificates will remain valid throughout their two-year life or more.



LEO:  That's a little longer than three hours.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  Exactly.  And not only can those certificates be used to host a spoofed website, if a victim's traffic can somehow be rerouted, but those same certificates can be used to sign spoofed email from the victim domain, and it will pass right through all SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation.  So my point is, it's likely that for commercial entities owning valuable domains, security is more important at their domain registrar than any other single other place.  I know that many of our listeners of this podcast have their own domains.  So if you were only to use multifactor authentication in one place, I would choose authenticating to your domain's registrar and doing anything possible to limit anyone else's ability to perform malicious account recovery.



It's a little bit like freezing your credit preemptively because you don't want bad guys to be able to apply for credit in your name.  I'm, you know, I have - I think I have one account over at Gandi.  I have nothing left at Network Solutions, but I'm all over at Hover.  And I've got second-factor authentication set up in both of those locations, and I smile every time I have to put my six-digit code in because I absolutely want to know that they're going to make sure that it's me because, again, the last thing you want is your domain to get hijacked.



So, and recall how LastPass suffered that first security event and then told us and thought that everything was fine.  But then later the bad guys were able to use some of the information they had gleaned from that first attack to launch a deeper and much more destructive event.  You know, that sort of thing might well plague these Ether.fi folks in the future.  It may not be all over.  You know, they think everything's been buttoned up.  But, you know, that brief nameserver switcheroo may have provided the bad guys with everything they were actually after.  



LEO:  So if you're a bad guy, time is of the essence.



STEVE:  That's right.



LEO:  Make sure you get it all done fast.



STEVE:  And you can imagine that they were probably poised, knowing that they wouldn't have it for long.  But the moment they got the nameserver switched, they jumped on it and probably issued certs at a bunch of different CAs.  Who knows?



LEO:  Wow.  Wow.



STEVE:  Okay.  Roskomnadzor.



LEO:  We're supposed to say it together.  You ready?  You ready?  Wait a minute.  It's hard with Zoom.  One, two, three.  Roskomnadzor.



STEVE:  Roskomnadzor.



LEO:  How about this?  [Voice filter] Roskomnadzor.



STEVE:  Oh, that's good.  We'll just put that over in your - you're in charge of saying that from now on.



LEO:  I'll be in charge from now on.



STEVE:  That's good.  That's really a good voice, too.  Turns out that the social media platform Discord is on the way to being banned in Russia, our favorite Russian...



LEO:  That's bad.  That's where all of our Club TWiT members live.



STEVE:  Yeah.  Our favorite Russian Internet watchdog - Leo, what's their name?



LEO:  Roskomnadzor.



STEVE:  That's them.  They just added Discord to their registry, which is the first step in formally blocking access to a service within Russia's borders.



LEO:  What did they do to get that?



STEVE:  They're just, you know, they're not toeing the line.  They're not sufficiently obedient.  They're not under the Kremlin's control.



LEO:  That's why we love them, yup.



STEVE:  So the Kremlin doesn't want them loose.



LEO:  Wow.



STEVE:  Just a note for users of the extremely popular VLC VideoLAN player.  The project just released a patch to repair an integer overflow vulnerability via a maliciously crafted MMS stream.



LEO:  Ooh.



STEVE:  I don't use VLC to receive MMS streams.  But if you do, you want to fix that.  The update notes that this could at least be used to crash VLC at a bare minimum; and that, although no one had ever created a remote code vulnerability execution, we know that the possibility of that being done cannot be ruled out.  If you are using VLC media player anywhere from 3.0.21 or later, that problem has been resolved.



Also, we've had lots of fun in years past looking at the Tor Project, actually the technology of it, which is so cool because it implements a unique privacy-preserving so-called "Onion Routing" technology.  For those who have joined us more recently, I'll just briefly recap that.



The Tor system wraps an outbound Internet packet in multiple successive layers of encryption where the private key used to decrypt each successive layer is only known to the specific router to which that "onion packet" will be sent.  So after wrapping the outbound packet multiple times, the sender sends this multiply wrapped "onion" to the first router, which is only able to remove the outer layer of encryption to reveal the address of the next onion router in the sequence.  It cannot determine - that is it, the first router, cannot determine the packet's final destination nor its contents because that's still hidden by multiple additional layers.  And although that first router knows the sender's IP, since it just received a packet from that IP, the second router that receives the forwarded packet does not know the sender's IP.  It only knows the IP of the first router.



When that onion reaches the second router, it and only it is able to decrypt and remove that layer of the onion, thus revealing the IP for the third router in the sequence.  And that second router only knows the IP of the first router and the third router, neither the originating IP nor the destination IP.  So every hop along the way we have protection of the sender, and also protection of the destination until you get to the final router.



Once the third router receives the onion, only it is able to remove that final layer to reveal the packet's actual contents and its true destination, and it has no idea whatsoever who originated that packet since that's three hops back.  And onion routers are all about preserving anonymity.



So that clever multilayered wrapping encryption is the essence of the Onion Routing system whose entire purpose is to give Internet users something that is completely lacking from the Internet's normal point-to-point routing scheme, which is a high degree of anonymity for the sender.  When we've talked about how the Internet works, typical packets have a sending IP and a receiving IP.  And so there's nothing anonymous from a standpoint of IP addresses.  Those are typically known endpoint to endpoint.



Okay.  So the other component here is the privacy-centric OS project Tails.  Tails is an operating system which is bootable from a USB thumb drive.  The Tails website bills itself as "Your secure computer anywhere," and it explains the OS's purpose, writing:  "To use Tails, shut down your computer and re-start it with your Tails USB stick instead of starting Windows, macOS, or Linux.  You can temporarily turn your own computer into a secure machine.  You can also stay safe while using the computer of somebody else.  Tails is a 1.5GB download and takes about half an hour to install.  Tails can be installed on any USB stick with 8GB minimum.  Tails works on most computers less than 10 years old.  You can start again on the system's original operating system after you've shut down Tails."  So, you know, you pull it out and reboot, and the system comes back normally.



They said:  "You don't have to worry about the system having viruses because Tails runs independently from the other operating system and never uses the hard disk.  But Tails cannot always protect you if you install it from a computer with viruses, or if you use it on a computer with malicious software, like keyloggers."  So don't do that.



"Tails always starts from the same clean state" - clean state and slate - "and everything you do disappears automatically when you shut down Tails.  Without Tails, almost everything you do can leave traces on the computer:  the websites you visited, even in private mode; files that you opened, even if you deleted them; passwords, even if you use a password manager; and all the devices and Wi-Fi networks that you touched.  On the contrary," they said, "Tails never writes anything to the hard drive and only runs from the memory of the computer.  The memory is entirely deleted when you shut down Tails, erasing all possible traces."



Okay.  Why are we talking about this?  We're revisiting these two important projects today because last Thursday under the blog headline "Uniting for Internet Freedom:  Tor Project and Tails Join Forces," they announced their merger.  The two projects realized that there was a great deal of duplicated effort with managing and fundraising and operational overhead.



The Tor blog said this.  They wrote:  "Today the Tor Project, a global non-profit developing tools for online privacy and anonymity, and Tails, a portable operating system that uses Tor to protect users from digital surveillance, have joined forces and merged operations.  Incorporating Tails into the Tor Project's structure allows for easier collaboration, better sustainability, reduced overhead, and expanded training and outreach programs to counter a larger number of digital threats.  In short, coming together will strengthen both organizations' ability to protect people worldwide from surveillance and censorship.



"Countering the threat of global mass surveillance and censorship to a free Internet, Tor and Tails provide essential tools to help people around the world stay safe online.  By joining forces, these two privacy advocates will pool their resources to focus on what matters most:  ensuring that activists, journalists, and other at-risk and everyday users will have access to improved digital security tools.



"In late 2023, Tails approached the Tor Project with the idea of merging operations.  Tails had outgrown its existing structure.  Rather than expanding Tails' operational capacity on their own and putting more stress on Tails' workers, merging with the Tor Project, with its already larger and established operational framework, offered a solution.  By joining forces, the Tails team can now focus on their core mission of maintaining and improving Tails OS, exploring more and complementary use cases while benefiting from the larger organizational structure of the Tor Project."



LEO:  This is so great.  This is so great.



STEVE:  Yeah.  This is really good, and makes them both stronger.  They finish, saying:  "This solution is a natural outcome of the Tor Project and Tails' shared history of collaboration and solidarity.  Fifteen years ago, Tails' first release was announced on a Tor mailing list.  Tor and Tails developers have been collaborating closely since 2015, and more recently Tails has been a sub-grantee of Tor.  For Tails, it felt obvious that, if they were to approach a bigger organization with the possibility of merging, it should be the Tor Project.



"The team lead for Tails OS said:  'Running Tails as an independent project for 15 years has been a huge effort, but not for the reasons you might expect.  The toughest part wasn't the tech.  It was handling critical tasks like fundraising, finances, and human resources.'"



LEO:  And dealing with people.



STEVE:  Exactly.  Those pesky critters.  "'After trying to manage those in different ways,' he said, 'I am very relieved that Tails is now under the Tor Project's wing.  In a way, it feels like coming home.'"



LEO:  Oh, that's such a good thing.



STEVE:  So, yeah.



LEO:  Have you used Tails?  Do you, I mean, I've read about it for years, and I've always been interested.



STEVE:  And we've talked about it in the past.  My use case, you know, I just don't have a use.



LEO:  You have to be very adamant about not wanting to be tagged.



STEVE:  Yeah.  I once talked about the danger, I mean, I can't even imagine logging into one of those hotel business centers' computers and doing anything that mattered there because it's like, uh, no.  Now, of course you and I are always carrying multiple computers around with us, so it's not like we have to use somebody else's.  But, you know, in a pinch, if you were to stick a USB drive in and reboot the machine with your own clean OS, that's probably as good as you can do.



LEO:  Microsoft used to offer, and they stopped it, a version of Windows that would erase itself on reboot, every time, fresh version.  And I know a lot of business centers used it.  And of course it's gone.



STEVE:  And, you know, there were some add-on packages back in the day.  I remember...



LEO:  I remember.  That's right.



STEVE:  Yeah.  Like sometimes libraries would use them.



LEO:  Exactly.



STEVE:  Where somebody would log on, they could use the system, you know, and any changes that they made would be completely reverted.  Basically it would reset all of those changes and always have the system back in a given state.



LEO:  Thanks, [Name].  That's it.  SteadyState was a Microsoft product, yeah.



STEVE:  SteadyState, yes.



LEO:  Yeah.  What a great idea.  Why did they stop it?  God knows.  Because it's Microsoft.



STEVE:  Well, you can't run Recall in a SteadyState machine.



LEO:  We'll get to that in a moment, yeah.



STEVE:  That's right.  Also, one last little bit of blurb here.  As we noted a few weeks ago, Telegram's founder and owner, Pavel Durov, was first detained, then arrested in France, after authorities decided to hold him directly responsible for the many abuses known to be flourishing within the totally unmoderated and unfiltered protection of Telegram's service.



Well, France's strategy appears to have worked since Telegram recently made some waves by amending its privacy policy and agreeing to comply with court orders requiring it to share its users' phone numbers and IP addresses with law enforcement.  So Telegram's cooperation will now extend to various criminal investigations expanding beyond their previous limit of only helping in terror-related offenses.  And as you might imagine, the exodus has actually been something to behold.  I saw a couple articles saying that the bad guys were jumping ship in large numbers.  So good riddance.



LEO:  Good, good.



STEVE:  Yes.  That's exactly what we want.



LEO:  And I'm glad to hear it because I like Telegram.  And I would like to use it without feeling bad about it.



STEVE:  Yeah.  And I would argue that as long as you're, I mean, okay, so we know that we have privacy absolutists, right, who absolutely feel that zero consequence of using the Internet in any way they choose should be their right.  Unfortunately, they're using somebody else's platform.  I mean, we've talked about it.  For example, employees in a corporation.  What you do on the company network with the company computer is the company's property, and the company has some responsibility for it.  So, you know, as we've said, it'd be a good thing to have a little sign posted on the top of the computer screen saying, "Remember, what you do on this network should not be considered private."  You know, it's not your network.  It's your employer's network.  Anyway, so, yes, goodbye, really, really bad cretins from Telegram.  We will not miss you.



LEO:  Yes.  We will not.  Not at all.



STEVE:  So I've got some feedback to share, Leo.  Why don't we take one more break.  



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  We'll get into the feedback before, and then on the other side of that we'll talk about the Re-Rollout of Recall.



LEO:  And YZF Donor reminds me that there is still a commercial program called Deep Freeze that does what SteadyState does.



STEVE:  Ah, right.



LEO:  I remember that, yeah.  Not free.



STEVE:  And they're still around.  That's good to know.



LEO:  Yeah, yeah, I'm glad to hear that.  Although, you know, I think Tails - Benito, our producer, said "The reason Windows stopped doing it is because they can't show you ads if you keep erasing everything."  Yeah, that might be.  That might be.  Tails might be the right way to go on that one.



STEVE:  One of our listeners wrote:  "Hello.  I'm a long-time listener and a much longer time developer.  Currently I write mostly for mobile and have apps on the Android Play Store.  From time to time I receive emails from 'companies' that want to buy my app and my," he says, "[not many] users.  But yesterday I received something new.  This guy wants to 'rent' my account to publish his own junk.  As you can see, he doesn't value my reputation much."



And then our listener George enclosed the note.  I've redacted some things.  So the email that he received to his Gmail account said:  "Good day, GreenSpot.  This is Bytom Gaming Hub.  We are reaching out to partner with Google Play Console Account owners for a lasting collaboration to publish our app."



LEO:  Oh, please.



STEVE:  "Our compensation plan includes $70 for each app upload."



LEO:  Oh, now I know it's a scam.  Okay.



STEVE:  "$10 for each app update, and $50 every seven days while the app is on your account.  If you're interested in collaborating with us, please contact us via WhatsApp at," and then they gave their WhatsApp number.  "Yours Sincerely, Bytom Gaming Hub."



What occurred to me is that two years ago, in 2022, Cory Doctorow brilliantly coined the term "enshittification."



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  His use was intended to be aimed at a single company's decline in product quality over time.  As Wikipedia defines the term, Wikipedia says:  "Enshittification (alternately, crapification and platform decay) is a pattern in which online products and services decline in quality.  Initially, vendors create high-quality offerings to attract users, then they degrade those offerings to better serve business customers, and finally degrade their services to users and business customers to maximize profits for shareholders."  Okay.  So Cory didn't define the term to be used more broadly.  But it's so tempting to also use the term to describe what we're all feeling, overall, about just sort of the general decline in the quality of the Internet's service as a whole.



So that term comes to mind when we see low-quality apps attempting to pay their way into the accounts of higher-quality apps as a means of riding their reputations.  The only reason somebody would pay to have their app offered within someone else's account would be because the value derived from advertising there would be more than the cost of doing so.  Of course the overall result is the gradual "enshittification" of the platform as a whole as the valuable reputation of developers is cashed out and watered down to no longer carry the value it once did.



Our listener who shared this was clearly unmoved by the offer.  But it is foreseeable that many others would jump at the chance to obtain some additional income from monetizing whatever loyalty their name may have earned.  I don't know, Leo.



LEO:  That's terrible.  That doesn't sound - it seems like there's got to be more to this.  I mean, like, there's some - they want to put malware on people's - I mean, 70 bucks?



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  There's something going on here.



STEVE:  And it would probably be $70 would be all the person would ever see.



LEO:  Maybe.



STEVE:  They would never see $50 per week, you know, ongoing revenue.



LEO:  It doesn't seem credible.  Yeah, yeah.



STEVE:  Yeah.  Bad.  Okay.  Another listener, Marv, said:  "Hi, Steve.  I wanted to give some feedback on the availability of 'Not Till We Are Lost:  Bobiverse, Book 5.'  After hearing you mention it was published this month, I've been waiting for the Kindle edition on Amazon.  And waiting.  And waiting.  It turns out we Kindle readers will have to wait a few months due to the author Dennis Taylor's agreement with Audible."  And so this was signed "Marvin Rhoads, Senior Network Security Engineer."  Anyway, so...



LEO:  That happens a lot.  Yeah.



STEVE:  And he linked to Dennis's FAQ, where Dennis asks the question and answers it:  "Where's the Kindle version?"  And Dennis wrote:  "Audible likes to have an exclusivity deal with its authors.  During negotiations, they'll try for up to a six-month gap before the text versions are produced.  The inducements to the author are:  Audible pays for the narrator.  Audible pays for the cover.  Audible does the marketing.  Audible offers a much larger advance.  Audible is also responsible for about two thirds," he said, "of my total income.  So they are by..."



LEO:  Yeah, you don't make much on Kindle.  That's probably part of it; right.



STEVE:  Right.  He said:  "So they are by definition my primary publisher."  He said:  "Fortunately, my agent, who is a bit of a pit bull, has kept the exclusive period down to four months."



LEO:  Oh, good.



STEVE:  "So the text version for the current contracts, anyway, will always come out four months after the Audible version."



LEO:  Oh, good.



STEVE:  And while I was there on his page I read the rest of Dennis's FAQ; and his irreverent personality, which so many of us have enjoyed in his novels, shows through clearly.  Two additional FAQ entries which also provide some additional interesting background are:  "Where's the EPUB or other version?"  Answer, he said:  "Amazon only lists your work in Kindle Unlimited if you go exclusive with Amazon for the electronic version.  That means no EPUB or Kobo or Google Play version.  Before you ask, KU [Kindle Unlimited] is probably about 25% of my non-Audible revenue."



LEO:  Oh, wow.



STEVE:  And that's, yeah, he says:  "And that's still a serious chunk of change.  See below for discussion of fiduciary greed."



LEO:  So, you know what, I just always assumed that Audible, I mean, Kindle Unlimited was a bad deal for authors, like they would get nothing or a penny or something.  So that's actually encouraging.  It's a quarter of his revenue.



STEVE:  And we know from previously looking into this, and I'm sure you'll remember this, how far you read in the book is actually tied to the - they actually get paid per page that you're reading.



LEO:  It's pretty hard not to finish a Bobiverse book, I'm just going to say.  I don't know about the new one.  But, boy, the first four were page turners, they were so good.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  And I listened to them on Audible.  He's got the best reader ever.  They were great.



STEVE:  Right.



LEO:  Yeah, you read them on Kindle; right?



STEVE:  Yeah.  I do, because I like actual text.  He said:  "When I originally self-published Outland, I initially went wide (Kobo, EPUB, Google Play, et cetera).  If I made so much as a penny from any of those other channels, I don't remember it."



LEO:  Oh, wow.  Oh, that's too bad.



STEVE:  He says:  "When I switched to Amazon exclusivity and Kindle Unlimited, my Amazon revenue went up about 20%."



LEO:  Well, I think you get some credit for promoting the Bobiverse books.  I think maybe he didn't know, but Steve's recommendation was a big part of this.



STEVE:  We know that it was a huge hit among our listeners.



LEO:  Oh, they're such a good book, yeah.



STEVE:  So that's why I wanted to circle back and mention this.  He said:  "My Amazon revenue went up about 20%.  So there's literally no inducement for me to consider going wide with my novels."  And then he says:  "Question:  So it's all about money?"  And he says:  "The answer is oh, hell, yes."



LEO:  Yeah, good for him.



STEVE:  He said:  "This writing thing isn't a hobby, and I'm not independently wealthy.  I have to pay a mortgage, me and my family have grown accustomed to eating regularly, and I'd like the bank to not take my car back."  He said:  "I literally quit my day job so I could write full-time, which means I can produce books a lot more quickly, but also means I have to be concerned about the financial aspects of my 'job.'  So when they wave a wad of bills under my nose, I pay attention.  Sorry, that's just the way it is."



LEO:  I so understand how he feels about that because people do the same thing to us.  They assume that I'm doing this for fun.  Which I am.  Just because you like something and you're good at it doesn't mean you shouldn't also get paid for it.  And it really annoys a lot of people that we have a club, for instance, that charges seven bucks, or that we run ads.  This is life.  Be a grownup; you know?  We've got to get paid.  We pay Steve.  I mean, I'm sure you love doing this, and you would do it for free.



STEVE:  I have a wife.



LEO:  But I would never ask you to because you deserve to get paid to do this.  And so does Dennis Taylor.  Good on him for being honest about that.



STEVE:  Yeah.  I liked that, and I thought everyone would get a kick out of his personality showing through.



LEO:  Yeah, yeah.



STEVE:  Listener Ben shared a welcome tip.  He said:  "Hey, Steve.  I recall multiple complaints of Windows 10 asking to be backed up every time there's some sort of update, when many of us already have our own backup solution."  And I've heard Paul complain about this, too.  He said:  "Today I decided to see if there was a way to disable this.  Turns out there is."



LEO:  Woohoo.



STEVE:  "Under Settings > System > Notifications and actions, you're able to uncheck the option 'Suggest ways I can finish setting up my device to get the most out of Windows.'"  And apparently even after you have finished setting up your device, it leaves it checked on.  So Settings > System > Notifications and actions, and then uncheck "Suggest ways I can finish setting up my device to get the most out of Windows."  And with any luck, that's never going to happen again.



LEO:  No more suggestions.  Thank you, Windows.  Goodbye.



STEVE:  Yeah.  So Ben, thank you, thank you, thank you.  You know, I had never looked, and I had no idea that such an option was available.  You know, and I'm also plagued by it incessantly promoting its own solutions and asking do I want to have - would you like a second keyboard?  No.  I've got one is all I need.  Thank you.  I told you that, like, you know, three times already.



LEO:  I keep telling you that.



STEVE:  God.  So, you know, it occurred to me that that might be a nice addition to the next release of GRC's InControl freeware.  So I made a note of that in the project so, you know, if I ever return to it, I can see about adding that because, you know, how would you like Windows to stop bugging you to, like, set up OneDrive.  Yes.  Stop bugging me.



LEO:  So Settings > System > Notifications.



STEVE:  Notifications and actions.



LEO:  And then...



STEVE:  Systems > Notifications and actions.  Probably one of those little switches down there.



LEO:  There's sure a lot of them.  Notifications from the app store?  No.  Print cleanup notification.  I don't even know what that is.  Notification suggestions.  No.  Here it is.  Setup.  No.  Security and maintenance.  No.  Additional settings.  You have to really dig because - Show Windows welcome experience.  That's it.  After updates.  Nope, nope, nope.



STEVE:  There it is.



LEO:  And I don't want tips and suggestions, either.  So I just turned everything off.



STEVE:  You know, I got a piece of email, and unfortunately it got lost in the pile, but one of our listeners had a brilliant suggestion.  He said:  "Steve, why don't you use Windows Server 2022?"



LEO:  Right.



STEVE:  "As your desktop?"



LEO:  Because it doesn't have any crapware on it.



STEVE:  Exactly.  And as an MSDN developer...



LEO:  You have it.



STEVE:  I already have it.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  So it's like, that's just a brilliant suggestion.  So yes.  Instead of all of this, you know, oh, my god, those flipping tiles and...



LEO:  Well, they wouldn't dare do this to...



STEVE:  ...Solitaire and all that crap.



LEO:  ...businesses; right?  So they don't turn it on on the business stuff; right?



STEVE:  No.  Amazing.  Listener Matt wrote, get a load of this one:  "More Experian Woes.  Hi, Steve.  Because you mentioned some questionable security practice with Experian, I thought I'd mention that I am inadvertently the email-of-record for someone else's Experian account."



LEO:  Oh, god.



STEVE:  He said:  "I was an early Gmail adopter and have the Gmail address of my first initial, last name at Gmail dot com.  I routinely get messages to others in the world who share my first initial and same last name.  Occasionally, someone will sign up for services and enter my email address by mistake, forgetting to add whichever qualifiers distinguish their email from mine."  He said:  "It's usually harmless, but someone recently signed up for an Experian account with their information and my email address."  He said:  "Now I receive email messages every time they have a credit alert."



LEO:  Oh, my.



STEVE:  He said:  "Conscious organizations have a single-click opt-out for messages, but for me to turn this off I have to log into Experian as that user.  This wouldn't be a problem because I could easily reset the account password, as I own the email address behind it.  But I don't want to be exposed to any more of their personal details than I already am."  He said:  "It seems Experian doesn't bother with an email verification loop..."



LEO:  All they had to do.



STEVE:  Exactly, "...when setting up accounts, or at least they didn't when this person set theirs up."  Unbelievable.



LEO:  Oh, my goodness.



STEVE:  You know?  At this point it's not even clear how they could go about untangling that mess; right?  You know, we've looked extensively at how, due to the universal presence of the "I forgot my password" links, the security of our email is really what all of our login security comes down to.



LEO:  Right.



STEVE:  Usernames and passwords and even multifactor authentication are really only just logon accelerators since everything ultimately falls back to email.  So in this case, what happens when this account owner forgets their password and attempts to use the "I forgot my password" loop, you know, so that confirmation mail lands in Matt's inbox because they always had it wrong on their account.



LEO:  And meanwhile, now they're...



STEVE:  And now they can't get back in, and they can't confirm, like, that they lost their password.



LEO:  That's the other side of it.  Meanwhile, there's somebody who's going, I never get anything from Experian.  How do I get in?  But the thing is, Experian makes it easy to create multiple new accounts.  Like almost every time you go, if you want to do a credit freeze, you just create a new account with your last four of your social and your email.  And so that's all that happened is that person has abandoned that account and opened another one.  Meanwhile, it's still active.



STEVE:  Wow.



LEO:  Wow.  Terrible.  Horrible.



STEVE:  Edward McDonald said:  "Hello, Steve.  I recently updated to iOS 18 and saw where Apple now has an app for their password manager.  I wondered your thoughts on it versus some of the other password manager software, like 1Password.  Thanks, Ed."



Okay.  Since I'm personally hanging back with older Apple hardware, iOS 18 is not an option for me at the moment.  But when we talked about this back at announcement time, what I recall was that what Apple was doing was mostly just pulling together what they already had for password management, which was kind of buried and scattered around within iOS.  They were pulling it all into one place and giving it a more formal UI presence.  So, you know, the presence of Passkeys, and the need now to manage them, increased the need for iOS's password management to be somewhat more explicit.  So the value of any third-party password manager, whose primary benefit would be much wider cross-platform, you know, cross-ecosystem credential synchronization, is neither changed nor diminished with these recent changes to iOS 18.



LEO:  I agree.  I agree.



STEVE:  They just sort of gave you an icon for it.



LEO:  Yeah.  And honestly, it's a very secure system, really well implemented, I think; right?



STEVE:  Yup.



LEO:  The only drawback is it's not exactly cross-platform.  You can use it on Windows, but I don't think there's any way to use it on Android.



STEVE:  Right.



LEO:  But, yeah, if you're all Apple, why not?



STEVE:  A listener named "E" asked about our mailing solution.  He said:  "Hi, Steve.  We run a self-coded email system for doing weekly mailshots.  We would like to shift to third-party code while remaining self-hosted.  Recently, when you described your modernization effort on your email system, I seem to recall that you bought/licensed a system and wrote your own code around that.  I looked back at Security Now! transcripts, but I seem to have missed it.  Could you put me straight on this point?"



LEO:  How?  How?  We've only plugged it five times.



STEVE:  And we're about to do it again.



LEO:  He ought to give you a cut of all sales from now on.



STEVE:  Well, the problem is he's not charging me enough, or anybody enough.



LEO:  Uh-huh, no, it's a one-time purchase.



STEVE:  It's only $139, and I feel guilty that that's all I've paid for this thing.



LEO:  Don't feel guilty, Steve.  You've given him tens of thousands of dollars of publicity.  You've sold more of this product than anybody.



STEVE:  Anyway, it is so good.  I was so glad to see this question because, you know, and actually I just had a ton of use of it in the last week.  The more I use it, the more impressed I become.  You know, okay.  So the system is nuevoMailer [N-U-E-V-O-M-A-I-L-E-R dot com, neuvoMailer.com.  And as with anything new and sophisticated, I have to admit it took me a while to fully grok the way it works.  But the more I've used it, the more I've grown to appreciate its power.



It can be used in a simple production capacity, such as sending out a weekly mailing; or I would describe it as an emailing workstation, which is the way I've been using it as I've been shepherding GRC's creaky old email list through today's hyper spam-focused email climate.  Anyway, so again, E, neuvoMailer.com.  It is just so great.  I've gotten to know its author, a Greek author named Panos.  His name actually has about 17 more syllables, but Panos is the beginning of it.  And it's just - I'm so happy with my choice.



Oh, and DJ wrote:  "I just wanted to let you know that I received the SpinRite 6.1 upgrade email earlier today in my AOL/Verizon inbox.  It did not end up in my spam folder."  He said:  "I've been a dedicated listener of Security Now! since Episode 3, 'NAT Routers as Firewalls.'  I'm also a proud SpinRite owner and user, and I've successfully recovered priceless files for friends and family.  Even as an avid listener, I shouldn't admit this, but I've recovered some of my own files that weren't backed up.  Now, after the latest use of SpinRite, my SSD is transferring data like it's new again."



So anyway, naturally, all of that was music to my ears.  Over the past couple of weeks, but primarily last week, as I've just mentioned, I've been working to get 20 years of past SpinRite 6 owners notified of the availability of a no-charge upgrade to 6.1.  I finished that work on Thursday.  Everything went well, but Microsoft appeared to be unhappy with the level of spam complaints or bounces from emailing to these very old, you know, 20 years ago email addresses.  I have a test list of 53 people from GRC's newsgroups who've volunteered to receive various test mailings while I've been working to bring all this up and get it working.



On Saturday - so I did the mailing on Thursday.  On Saturday a test mailing to that list of 53 bounced back all, actually it was six of those people whose domains were handled by Microsoft, so Outlook.com, Hotmail.com, and Live.ca.  All were rejected from GRC.  So I found Microsoft's postmaster tools and asked about the block on our sending domain.  Their reply the next day on Sunday was they had no record of any block.  So I did another test mailing and, sure enough, none of those emails bounced again.



LEO:  It's a miracle.



STEVE:  But they did go to the users' junk folders.  So even though Microsoft let them through the front door, they sent them into the back room.  So I would not be surprised, I mentioned at the top of the show that we're just shy now of 10,000 subscribers to the Security Now! list.  So last afternoon/evening I sent out the mailing for today's podcast to 9,977 or something listeners.  If you didn't see it, and you're a Microsoft user, look in your Outlook.com, Hotmail.com, Live.whatever, com or ca.  And if you would do me the favor of marking it as not junk, that would be great because at this point I think that's the only way we have of telling Microsoft, okay, we're sorry, we're not going to do that again, but we did manage to get out 20 years of email.  And it's been really fun, Leo, to see people's replies.



LEO:  Oh, that's so great.



STEVE:  They're like, SpinRite?  You've got to be kidding me.



LEO:  That's still around?



STEVE:  That's still alive?



LEO:  I get that all the time.  You're still alive?  All the time.



STEVE:  Yeah.  Okay.



LEO:  By the way, I said I would ring a bell when we hit 100 degrees?  [Bell ringing]



STEVE:  Oh, my.  No kidding.



LEO:  We are at 101 here in the TWiT attic studio.  Man, I want to go back to the Eastside Studio.  Please, where's my AC?  All right.



STEVE:  Okay.  One last piece about sci-fi.  This was from John Slanina, JammerB.  He said:  "Hi, Steve.  I understand not wanting to start it" - oh, and he's referring to Peter Hamilton's book - "to start it until the series is complete.  That's what I do with Frontiers Saga.  I like to read all 15 books back to back."



LEO:  Oh, wow.



STEVE:  And he said:  "(Three more 'episodes')" - meaning three more books - "(and I can devour Part 3)."  And he said:  "But it's Peter F. Hamilton."



LEO:  He loves Peter F. Hamilton, yeah.



STEVE:  Yeah.  He said:  "I'm halfway through, looking forward to rereading it before Part 2 comes out.  Enjoying it immensely. I will say it's great to have a book that is hard to put down.  I have many things I can be doing with all my free time.  I can tell you that getting back into this book is always at the top of the list."  And then he signed off:  "It's a little weird looking in from the outside of TWiT, but I will continue enjoying all the content TWiT produces.  Take care, John."



LEO:  Aw, JammerB.



STEVE:  So thank you, Jammer.



LEO:  Yeah, you know what, he did the same thing with the last one.  He just basically reads it, puts it down.  When the new one comes out, rereads the whole thing.  He's an inveterate reader.  He's, like you, a Kindle guy.



STEVE:  Yup.



LEO:  And he doesn't mind.  He likes to pick it up and do it again.  So we miss you, JammerB.



STEVE:  Yup.  I think I'm on my, maybe my fourth reread of the earlier books of the Frontiers Saga.  It's, I mean, I kind of know what's going to happen, but the characterization...



LEO:  You forget after a while.



STEVE:  ...is so good.



LEO:  Yeah, yeah.



STEVE:  It's just, I mean, you know, people rewatch movies because they see them as art.



LEO:  Right.



STEVE:  Right?  I mean, like...



LEO:  Exactly.



STEVE:  Such beautiful productions.  And this guy can really write.



LEO:  My only problem is I don't read that fast, and so there are so many things I want to read.  And I just - I don't want to reread something because I think, well, I'm missing something else.  But you know what, John, you convinced me.  I'm going to get the new Peter F. Hamilton, and I'll just reread it.



STEVE:  I think I'm going to do the same thing.  I'm going to read the - I'll read it, and then it's like, fine.  Well, and we did that with "Pandora's Star"; right?  We read the first one.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  And then it's like, uh.  And then when "Judas Unchained" finally came out, it was, okay, read the first one again.



LEO:  Exactly.



STEVE:  And now we slide right into the number two title.



LEO:  I will miss him.  John worked for us for almost 20 years.  I will miss - John's so funny.  I would go into the studio, and he'd go, "Oh, I can't, I want to tell you, I can't tell you, oh."  Because he, you know, he'd read this stuff ahead of time.  He loves it so much.  You know what, I'm going to read it.  I'm going to read it.  I'm going to read it.  And maybe John will do John's book club because he always liked Stacey's Book Club.  We could do John's Book Club and do the Peter F. Hamilton.  How about that?



All right.  We're going to talk about Recall.  And Microsoft's made yet more changes, but is it enough?  Steve will have the inside story.



STEVE:  Lipstick on a pig?



LEO:  All right.  Speaking of right and wrong, it's time to talk about Microsoft's Recall.  Still a pig?



STEVE:  So our listener Mike wrote:  "Leo and Steve.  While I can see some value in having a personal AI running from a user-created and selected database, I see far, far, more danger in this both currently and in the future.  I believe that it would require a redesigned PC and OS.  It could involve partitions or multiple memory devices.  It could also involve multiple data incompatible OSes and CPUs, perhaps running in some kind of sandbox.  It must be air-gapped from the Internet, and it certainly cannot be connected to a MS account.  Authentication would be local only, perhaps with a YubiKey, when querying the AI.  It would be independent of any Windows, lacking security functions.  An application running alongside but not actually in Windows.  Most likely different application for storing and retrieving data, as well.  Just doodling some ideas.  Signed, Mike."



Okay.  So that sort of sets things up here.  Way back when the Internet happened, Microsoft had ramped up to compete with AOL, CompuServe, The Source, and other dial-up services at the time.  Microsoft had what they were calling MSN, their Microsoft Network.  The sudden surging interest in the Internet appeared to take Bill Gates and company by surprise.  Windows at the time had local area networking with Microsoft's own LAN Manager and with third parties such as Novell.  But there was really no sort of WAN networking.



So they found a TCP/IP stack somewhere, hung it onto the Windows that they had, and put Windows onto the Internet.  The only trouble was, the phrase "Windows Network Security" at the time was an oxymoron.  And that was the motivation for my own initial entry into the world of online security, with the creation of ShieldsUP! to show people that, if they had previously shared their "C" drive on the private LAN, then now the entire world could see and browse around inside their machine's "C" drive.



The sudden appearance of the Internet represented a discontinuity in the use of Windows.  Microsoft was caught off guard without a good solution, so they shipped what they had, despite the fact that it was a total security disaster.  In the beginning, when ShieldsUP! was born, my web server was showing its visitors the contents of their hard drives in a browsable tree.  It was all accessible publicly, which it's hard to imagine today, but that was Windows on the Internet in the beginning.



So I was reminded of this, by analogy, because Recall represents a similar discontinuity in the use of Windows.  This is due to the fact that having an agent locally storing its user's entire computer usage history in machine-accessible form is not something that has ever been done before, and it represents a massive change in the system's security profile.  It's not sufficient to say "Oh, we'll just encrypt it," or "Don't worry, it's protected by Windows Hello."  Anyone trained in security knows that none of that is anything but feel-good nonsense.  It's salve for the masses.



Just as once upon a time Windows had never needed to have any kind of network security that was required to safely attach it to the Internet, Windows has never needed to have the kind of local desktop security that's required to allow it to safely accumulate and protect all of its users' past activity over time.  The good news is these fundamental truths were self-evident to anyone and everyone trained in security, and pretty much all of them started screaming and posting when Microsoft blithely dropped a functioning Recall beta into Windows Copilot+ PCs without any sort of protection - exactly as, back in Windows 95, they hooked Windows to the Internet without any preparation.



What's different between now and then is that we've lost our innocence.  Today, the world has 30 years of experience with security, and with Windows.  And even if Microsoft tends to forget that major new features really do need some peer review, the rest of the world is here to remind them.  And thanks to the Internet, the rest of the world has a microphone.



So last Friday David Weston, Microsoft's Vice President for Enterprise and OS Security, posted a comprehensive update on the state of Recall under the title:  "Update on Recall security and privacy architecture."  My first reaction to what they have done is to judge this as extremely impressive.  Microsoft clearly has some big guns who could not have been involved in Recall's initial design.  There was no sign of them then.  But they are now, and any reading of Recall's new protection system design would have to be prefixed with the statement to the rest of the security industry:  "Message received."



LEO:  Wow, that's great.  That's impressive.  Wow.



STEVE:  Yes.  Now, don't read this as, you know, me assuming that I will now be running Recall on my machines.



LEO:  Yeah, you'll never use it, yeah.



STEVE:  No.



LEO:  Don't be confused.



STEVE:  In the first place, only Windows 11 apparently will offer that option, and I'm only now beginning to feel really good about Windows 10.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  So, you know, I'll be Recall-free for the foreseeable future.  Actually I'll probably be running Windows Server 2022, so I'll be stuck there happily.  But I know that many of our listeners, their friends, their families, and others whose security they care about will be running Recall.  So it's definitely worth updating ourselves on what Microsoft has wrought.



Okay.  First off, on the "all or nothing" front, it appears that the option to remove Recall entirely - which our listeners will recall we talked about a few weeks ago - someone at Microsoft said was a bug, not a feature.  David is not saying the same.  He says, in fact, removing Recall entirely is a deliberate feature.



LEO:  Nice.  That's huge.



STEVE:  So, yes.  Under that Windows Features and Options, there will be a checkbox.  You can uncheck it and say "Update Windows," and Recall, all trace of it, will be gone.  So David's posting says, under "The user is always in control," he wrote:  "Recall is an opt-in experience.  During the set-up experience for Copilot+ PCs, users are given a clear option whether to opt-in to saving snapshots using Recall.  If a user does not proactively choose to turn it on, it will be off, and snapshots will not be taken or saved.  Users can also remove Recall entirely by using the Optional Features settings in Windows.



Okay.  Now, that said, Microsoft clearly wants everyone to turn this on.  David's posting shows a screenshot of the Recall offer, at least as it stands today.  And of course it's all glowing happiness.  The screen that comes up has the catchy offer:  "Unlock your photographic memory with Recall."  And it reads:  "If you allow Recall to save snapshots, an image of your screen will be saved every few seconds.  This will create a photographic memory for you of the apps, websites, documents, and images you've seen on your PC."



Then we have three benefits articulated here.  "First, easily find what you need.  Scroll through a timeline of your snapshots or describe what you're looking for, even text or images within a snapshot.  Two, pick up where you left off.  From a snapshot, you can seamlessly return to documents, images, emails, and web pages as you left them.  And three, you're always in control.  You choose if and when snapshots are saved, and only you can access them.  In Settings, you can choose which apps and websites to filter out of snapshots, delete snapshots, or change Recall settings anytime."  The page concludes with the question:  "Start saving snapshots of your screen on Recall?" with the options to "Learn more," or "Yes, save," or "No, don't save."



Okay.  That all sounds great, and we didn't expect Microsoft to laden their invitation with any concern over the security of the system's stored snapshots.  Right?  I mean, after all, it says under the third benefit that "only you can access them."  So, okay, then.  But here's where we get into the part that impressed me and which made it clear that what is now being presented came from some other place entirely than the initial entirely lame first Recall beta preview.  Here's what Microsoft has engineered after clearly awakening to the fact that there really is an awesome responsibility associated with gathering and locally storing all of this potentially very personal and private data.



They highlight three features.  First, sensitive data in Recall is always encrypted, and keys are protected.  Okay, that's an easy claim, but then they elaborate.  "Snapshots and any associated information in the vector database are always encrypted.  The encrypted keys are protected via the Trusted Platform Module, tied to a user's Windows Hello enhanced sign-in security identity, and can only be used by operations within a secure environment called a Virtualization-Based Security Enclave."  That's VBS Enclave.  And I wish it wasn't VBS because that sounds like Visual Basic Script, which is anything but rigorous.



LEO:  Microsoft's a master of overloading, I tell you.  They constantly do that.



STEVE:  Yeah.  So Virtualization-Based Security Enclave.  So they finish this point saying:  "This means that other users cannot access these keys and thus cannot decrypt this information."  Second, "Recall services that operate on snapshots and associated data are isolated.  Within Recall, the services that operate on screenshots and associated data or perform decryption operations reside within a secure VBS [again, Virtualization-Based Security] Enclave.  The only information that leaves the Enclave is what is requested by the user when actively using Recall.



"And third, users are present and intentional about the use of Recall.  Recall leverages Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security to authorize Recall-related operations.  This includes actions like changing Recall settings and run-time authorization of access to the Recall user interface.  Recall also protects against malware through rate-limiting and anti-hammering measures.  Recall currently supports PIN as a fallback method only after Recall is configured, and this is to avoid data loss if a secure sensor is damaged."  That is, the use of a PIN.  So you have that as a fallback if the Windows Enhanced Sign-in Security cannot be satisfied because of a sensor failure.



Okay.  So all of that means that Microsoft is using its hypervisor-based machine virtualization to create a fully isolated, you know, as isolated a container for this information as is possible without requiring an entirely new hardware design.  Microsoft explains what this means under their "Recall security model."  And the fact that they actually have a Recall security model, that's new, too.



So they wrote:  "Recall snapshots and associated data are protected by secure Virtualization-Based Secure Enclaves.  VBS Enclaves use the same hypervisor as Azure to segment the computer's memory into a special protected area where information can be processed.  Using Zero Trust principles, code in these enclaves can use cryptographic attestation protocols to safeguard that the environment is secure before performing sensitive operations, such as snapshot processing.  This area acts like a locked box that can only be accessed after permission is granted by the user through Windows Hello.  VBS Enclaves offer an isolation boundary from both kernel and admin users.  So no level of normal privilege escalation gets you across that barrier.



"Recall snapshots are available only after you authenticate using Windows Hello credentials.  Specifically, Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security biometric credentials protect your privacy and actively authenticate you to query your semantic indices and view associated snapshots.  Biometric credentials must be enrolled to search Recall content.  Using VBS Enclaves with Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security allows data to be briefly decrypted while you use the Recall feature to search.  Authorization will time out and require the user to re-authenticate access for future sessions.  This restricts attempts by latent malware trying to 'ride along' with a user authentication to steal data."



Okay.  So I'll just interrupt to note that none of this was present before.  What they released earlier wasn't - you couldn't even call it "half baked."  It wasn't even warm.  They then repeat the various UI features as privacy controls, you know, snapshot saving can be stopped and resumed, snapshots can be deleted, private browsing will never be recorded, et cetera.  But what really makes the difference here is Recall's security architecture.  And this is properly where most of their effort has been invested.



The core components of the Recall architecture - again, they actually have a Recall security architecture - are the following.  So there's Secure Settings.  They explain:  "A protected data store used within the Virtualization-Based Security Enclave, which stores security configuration data for Recall.  To make any changes to security-sensitive settings, a user must authorize the actions taken within the enclave to prevent malicious tampering.  In addition, the settings are secure by default, meaning if tampering is detected, they will revert to secure defaults."  So it's like, if the system is not sure about anything, it snaps to full security by default.  Again, that's proper security design.



Also, there's the Semantic Index.  They explain:  "The semantic index converts images and text into vectors for later search.  These vectors may reference private information extracted from snapshots, so these vectors are encrypted by keys protected within the Virtualization-Based Secure Enclave.  All query operations are performed within this VBS Enclave."



Then we have the Snapshot Store.  That "contains the saved snapshots and associated metadata, including any launch URIs provided by apps integrating with Recall User Activity API."  Now, I'll get to that in a minute because my eyes went, what?  Recall User Activity API.  This is the first we've heard of an API.  They said:  "As well as data like the time of the snapshot, title bar string, app dwell times, et cetera.  Each snapshot is encrypted by individual keys, and those keys are protected within the VBS Enclave."  Again, each snapshot is encrypted by individual keys, and those keys are protected within the Virtualization-Based Secure Enclave.



Then there's the User Experience, "the UI experience that users leverage to find things they've done on their PC, including timeline, search, and viewing specific snapshots."  And finally the Snapshot Service.  It is a "background process that provides the run time for saving new snapshots, as well as querying and processing data returned by the VBS Enclave.  Recall's storage services reside in a Virtualization-Based Secure Enclave to protect data, keys, and tampering from malware or attackers operating on the machine.  Recall components such as the Recall UI operate outside the VBS Enclaves and are untrusted in this architecture."  Again, somebody really thought this through, and they did this right.



"Because the Snapshot Service," they wrote, "must release information requested by a user by design, a key tenet of the design is to reduce the potential for exfiltration of data outside the normal use of the Recall system.  Processes outside the Virtualization-Based Secure Enclaves never directly receive access to snapshots or encryption keys, and they only receive data returned from the enclave after authorization.  The authorization period has a timeout and anti-hammering protections that limit the impact of malicious queries.



"The Snapshot Service is a protected process further limiting malicious access to memory containing the data returned from the query outside the Virtualization-Based Secure Enclave.  Protected processes are the same technology used to protect anti-malware and the Windows LSA host from attacks.  Lastly, the Recall Virtualization-Based Secure Enclave leverages concurrency protection and monotonic counters to prevent malicious users from overloading the system by making too many requests."



Okay.  So it should be completely clear that what we have today is no longer a set of SQL database files containing the user's history snapshots that were found lying around in a user's private directory in that initial public preview release.  This is an entirely new ballgame.  One thing there that caught my eye was the mention of a Recall User Activity API.  Huh?  What's that?



Some poking around discovered that this is the means by which it's possible to have Recall return to some past situation and allow the user to pick up from there.  As a developer, I was extremely skeptical about Windows' ability to do that, since it would have required snapshotting, not just the system's screen, but its entire running context, and that's just not possible or practical in any way.  It turns out that this "Recall User Activity API" is the means by which apps which have been modified to be "Recall Ready" can cooperate with Recall to make that sort of rewind-to-a-past-state possible.



For developers, under the heading "Use Recall in your Windows app," Microsoft explains.  They said:  "For those who opt-in by enabling 'Recall and snapshots' in Settings, Windows will regularly save snapshots of the customer's screen and store them locally.  Using screen segmentation and image recognition, Windows provides the power to gain insight into what is visible on the screen.  As a Windows application developer, you will now be able to offer your users the ability to semantically search these saved screenshots and find content related to your app.  Each snapshot has a UserActivity associated that enables the user to relaunch the content.



"A UserActivity refers to something specific the user was working on within your app.  For example, when a user is writing a document, a UserActivity could refer to the specific place in the document where the user left off writing.  When listening to a music app, the UserActivity could be the playlist that the user last listened to.  When drawing on a canvas, the UserActivity could be where the user last made a mark.  In summary, a UserActivity represents a destination within your Windows app that a user can return to so that they can resume what they were doing.  To engage with a UserActivity your Windows app would call UserActivity.CreateSession.  The Windows operating system responds by creating a history record indicating the start and end time for that UserActivity.  Reengaging with that same UserActivity over time will result in multiple history records being stored for it."



Okay.  So that explains a lot about how this can possibly work.  In short, it doesn't, until and unless the apps the user is running explicitly add support for it.  I'm sure users will be able to turn back the clock to look at what they were doing and to read saved screens.  But jumping back into an app at that point in time will require explicit support from the app.  I'm sure that Edge and Office and Microsoft's Windows apps will all offer this.  And it might, you know, become a competitive feature that other apps will need to remain at feature parity with the things that Microsoft is doing.  We'll see how that goes.



There's a bit more that I don't want to skip over in the interest of presenting the whole story.  Under "Additional architectural properties that are key to security for Recall," Microsoft adds, under "Bound and verified Virtualization-Based Secure Enclaves," they said, "Encryption keys used by Recall are cryptographically bound to the identity of the end user, sealed by a key derived from the TPM of the hardware platform and are performed entirely within the trusted boundary of Virtual Trust Level 1 (VTL1)."



Under "Virtualization-Based Security (VBS)," they said, "The hypervisor provides the secure enclave environment, which loads integrity-verified code into a confidential and isolated TEE (Trusted Execution Environment).



"Recall only operates on Copilot+ PCs that meet the secured-core standard and include the following capabilities by default, which are verified by Recall:  BitLocker (on Windows 11 Pro) and Device Encryption (on Windows 11 Home).  Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0:  The TPM provides the root of trust for the secure platform, management of keys used by the Secure Enclave, and additional platform hardening primitives, such as unforgeable monotonic counters."  The point being they know that the Recall data gets stored on the user's hard drive.  It will be strongly encrypted at rest.



"Also virtualization-based security and hypervisor-enforced code integrity.  Also Measured Boot and System Guard Secure Launch.  If a machine is not booted securely, it cannot attest to the system's security state and release keys, which can unseal content previously protected, thus mitigating early boot attacks."  And finally, "Kernel DMA Protection against peripheral attacks must be present and will be verified before Recall will unlock."



And finally and significantly, under "Recall security reviews," they said:  "In addition to designing and architecting Recall with security, privacy, and responsible AI in mind, we have also conducted a set of thorough security assessments of the feature.  This includes the following efforts to ensure a thoughtful and secure approach."  They have three points:  "First, the Microsoft Offensive Research and Security Engineering team (MORSE) has conducted months of design reviews and penetration testing on Recall.  Second, a third-party security vendor was engaged to perform an independent security design review and penetration test."



LEO:  Good, good.



STEVE:  Yes.  "And third, a Responsible AI Impact Assessment was completed which covered risks, harms, and mitigations analysis across our six RAI" - that's Responsible AI Impact - "RAI principles:  fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability."  They said:  "A cohesive RAI Learn and Support document was developed for increasing awareness internally, and external-facing RAI content was published to drive trust and transparency with our customers."



Okay.  This is so much more than that original collection of SQL files, as I said, stored in a user's private directory, that it should be abundantly clear that today's Recall implementation bears no resemblance whatsoever to the disaster waiting to happen that Microsoft originally proposed.



This is why I felt it necessary to give Recall's Re-Rollout an entire podcast topic of its own.  It would not be fair to Microsoft for our opinion of Recall to remain colored by that first impression.  The difference between then and now is so stark that I have no explanation for what that first thing was, where it came from, or who did it.  You know, it feels like it was nothing more than an innocent first-pass proof-of-concept that some idiot in marketing insisted upon shipping immediately because it was so amazing.  You know, yes, it's amazing.  But it could also never have been safe, and never could be safe, unless it was also implemented correctly.



Fortunately, the entire security industry rose up and collectively said "What the Actual F" and got Microsoft's attention.  What we have now, what is protecting Recall's aggregated user data, is a seriously well-thought-out state-of-the-art security architecture.  And they're even, you know, they've even had it reviewed by outsiders.



Now, even given all that, the number one lesson we have learned about security is that there are no exceptions to this rule; that only time will tell whether this will be enough.  But at least it looks like it now stands a chance.



LEO:  Yay.



STEVE:  So bravo to Microsoft.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  They know they have a potential, I mean, earth-changing feature for Windows.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  And I can't explain what that first thing was.  But we really need to forgive them because they got it right this time.



LEO:  Did it right this time around.  That's really, you know, that's great.  It's good news.  Very nice.  And I'm glad that you were able to come on and give it a once-over and say, "good."  Not that you will ever run it.



STEVE:  I will never run it.



LEO:  And [crosstalk] it's really insecure.



STEVE:  Never say never.  I mean, okay, first of all, you know, maybe Windows 12 because, you know, Windows 11 is just one of those like Vista.  It's one that you - or 8 - that you just - it's one of those skip-over versions, yeah.



LEO:  All right.  All right.  Steve Gibson.  You've done it again, as always, brought together a two-hour and 10-minute extravaganza of security news, and we're so glad that you did it, and we're so glad that you all joined us for it.

What's going on, and what can be done?



SHOW TEASE:  It's time for Security Now!.  Steve Gibson, our guru of security, is here with some surprising news.  Turns out Meta hasn't been bothering to hash its passwords for some time.  PayPal's about to sell your purchase histories.  Steve explains how to stop that.  And then finally we're going to explain this whole kerfuffle over Manifest V3, the inability to use uBlock Origin with Chrome, and a little download that will keep you using uBlock Origin, at least for another six months.  All that and a whole lot more coming up next on Security Now!.



LEO LAPORTE:  This is Security Now! with Steve Gibson, Episode 995, recorded Tuesday, October 8th, 2024:  uBlock Origin and Manifest V3.



It's time for Security Now!, the show where we get together and talk about your privacy, your security, your well-being online with our well-being professor, Dr. Steve Gibson.



STEVE GIBSON:  Actually, because we're going to mention Vitamin D briefly today...



LEO:  Uh-huh.  See?



STEVE:  It is a bit of a well-being podcast.  Actually...



LEO:  Lisa's doctor said "I want you to do at least 1,000 IUs."  I do 5,000 daily.  I said, well, just use mine.  He said:  "Make sure it's a good provider."



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  But he says, and because she's a menopausal woman, calcium and Vitamin D are very important.  In fact, for those of us who no longer - our skin no longer manufactures Vitamin D from the sun, and because we're told don't go in the sun whatever you do...



STEVE:  Or we'll be scraping things off of your skin later in life...



LEO:  I'm going to the dermatologist at the end of the month.  I asked my doctor, said "Do you think this is a problem?"  He took a picture with an iPhone with a special lens on it.  He said, "Let's get our camera in."  It was an iPhone but it had a special lens on it.  And they took a picture like that and sent it to the dermatologist.  Got a call the next day from the nurse.  She said, "It's not cancer, but we would like to see you."  Okay.  I think I'll be getting scraped at the beginning of the month.



STEVE:  Bring your wallet.



LEO:  Bring your wallet.  Steve, what's coming up today on Security Now!?



STEVE:  Okay.  So we've got some follow-up on something we talked about several years ago, about Meta having been found not to be bothering to hash their login, their users' login passwords.  Which it's just like, what?



LEO:  In this day and age, really?



STEVE:  It's unbelievable, yes.  Also, PayPal is going to begin selling its users' purchase histories, unless we turn that off.  However, Leo, because you and I are both in California, we don't have to turn it off.



LEO:  Oh, hallelujah.



STEVE:  Anyway, we'll be talking about that.



LEO:  Yup.



STEVE:  There's also two other states that don't have to opt out.  They are auto-opted out.  We have broken - "we" meaning bad guys - broken 2021's record for the maximum DDoS size.



LEO:  Not a good record.



STEVE:  Not a good record.  It didn't last very long.  But, boy, if those wires could melt, this would have melted them.  It's also National Cybersecurity Month.  When was the last time you updated your router's firmware?  North Korean hackers, there's more news about these guys successfully posing as domestic IT workers.  Also we're going to pose and answer the question, why would a security-related podcast ever talk about Vitamin D?  Also, what's another way the recent Linux CUPS vulnerability has been found to be weaponizable?



LEO:  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.



STEVE:  What's the secure consumer WiFi router of choice today?



LEO:  Oh.



STEVE:  That's a listener question that we're going to answer.



LEO:  I have an answer, too, which is what we use, but keep going, yeah.



STEVE:  Okay.  And also what should be done to further secure it after its purchase.  And recent troubles with Gorhill.



LEO:  Our good friend Gorhill.



STEVE:  You know, if John Dvorak wrote software, that would be Raymond Hill.



LEO:  Raymond's a little cranky.  Just a little cranky.



STEVE:  Yes.  So recent troubles with him.  He's uBlock Origin's dad, and specifically its Lite edition has shined some light - and I don't know if you would say "shone."  Is that shone?



LEO:  Has shined.  Has shone.  Has shone some light.



STEVE:  Shined a light.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  On Chrome's coming content-blocking add-on restrictions.  It turns out I've discovered a way of postponing the inevitable.



LEO:  Oh, good.



STEVE:  But at least you get till next summer.  We're going to look deeply at what's going on and what can be done.



LEO:  Oh, good.



STEVE:  And since fully half of the podcast is going to be that rather entertaining discussion, we'll move our ad inserts appropriately.



LEO:  Well, I'm very interested in this Manifest V3.  It feels like Google doesn't want you to run an adblocker.  I wonder why?



STEVE:  Uh-huh.



LEO:  But, you know, and it would be a reason for me to abandon Chrome, frankly, if I can't run uBlock Origin.



STEVE:  Yup.



LEO:  I don't want to go out on the web without it.  All right.  It's going to be a good show.  Plus a Picture of the Week.



STEVE:  It's already had some great feedback.  Again, I'll just note to all of our listeners that 10,100 and some odd of our listeners received the show notes, the Picture of the Week.



LEO:  Last night.  Last night.



STEVE:  Yeah, last night.



LEO:  I'm sitting there watching a movie with Lisa, she said, "Oh, the show notes are here."  So apparently Lisa subscribes, too.



STEVE:  Yeah, well, Lorrie has been bugging me for years to start sooner so that I'm less in a froth and a panic.



LEO:  That's what I told her.  I said, "This is the new Steve Gibson."  She said, "It's probably Lorrie."



STEVE:  Yes, this is a married podcaster.



LEO:  Awesome.  Well, we love our wives, and thank goodness they're keeping an eye on us.  All right, I'm ready, Steve.  Picture of the Week time.



STEVE:  We didn't talk about this before, and I assume you have not seen it.



LEO:  I have just seen the headline, "Modern Product Packaging Can Be a Challenge."



STEVE:  Yes.



LEO:  All right.  So [laughing].  Okay, okay, okay.  Together, we'll look at this together.  I'm sorry.  It's hard not to laugh here.  Wait a minute.  Let me make it big.



STEVE:  No, you're supposed to laugh.  That's the whole point.



LEO:  Okay.  Okay.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  You have a pair of scissors, and you have those horrible blister packages.



STEVE:  Oh, my god.  And, you know, I'm surprised there's not blood on the table somewhere.



LEO:  I know.  They're just awful.



STEVE:  Yes, yes.  So for those who don't have the advantage of seeing the Picture of the Week from the show notes, this shows that some hapless individual used a pair of scissors to open their Logitech corded mouse.



LEO:  Oh.



STEVE:  Unfortunately, where they chose to cut across the package with their scissors cut the mouse's tail.  That is, its cord.  A number of people have replied and said, well, that's one way to get a cordless mouse.



LEO:  Not the right way.



STEVE:  Not the right way, no.  Anyway, it's just a great picture because...



LEO:  It's probably from a real person because who hasn't done this; right?  This is just...



STEVE:  Actually, several people wrote and said, "Yeah, I've done something like that."  It's like, I mean, they really are awful.  Sometimes they, like, they will hide the instructions for using the thing inside so when you cut across it...



LEO:  Right across it.



STEVE:  ...you're like cutting the instruction manual in half.  I mean, it's just - it's very convenient for high-volume packaging, but all of the burden is transferred to the user, who is, as we said, you know, you have to, like - what I do is I carefully cut around the perimeter, yet then you've got to watch out that you don't get stabbed by the sharp edge of the packaging that has been cut by the scissors.  It's just bad.  So anyway, thank you.  One of our listeners sent this to me.  The Pictures of the Week are listener-sourced.  So I very much appreciate them.



LEO:  We're going to fix this lower third, Benito.  It says Wednesday, and it is not Wednesday. 



STEVE:  It is not.



LEO:  So if anybody's watching and saying, "Oh, my god, it's Wednesday," no, it's not.



STEVE:  But it is the 8th, so that's...



LEO:  It is the 8th, yes.



STEVE:  Okay.  So Ars Technica carried the news that officials in Ireland have fined Meta $101 million US for their storing of hundreds of millions of user passwords in plaintext rather than hashing them, which of course as we know provides both breach and internal employee abuse protection.  Ars first reported this conduct, and we talked about it five years ago, back in 2019.  And at the time Ars used the headline:  "Facebook apps logged users' passwords in plaintext because why not," with the subhead "Unencrypted user credentials stored on Facebook's internal servers as far back as 2012."



You know, and this sort of shows a problem in general that we see occurring in all different sorts of places because our technology, the way technology has been implemented is opaque.  And, you know, I mean, it's true everywhere; right?  Like we don't know the plastic that our seat cushions are made of and whether it's outgassing carcinogens.  We just hope that they aren't.  But, you know, how do you know?  And we have no idea who is responsibly storing our credentials.  We only find out that they haven't been when a breach occurs, and all of the passwords are in plaintext and not hashed.



Anyway, back in 2019, when we talked about this, Facebook said - I'm sorry, not Facebook, Ars reporting said:  "Facebook has mined a lot of data about its users over the years - relationships, political leanings, and even phone call logs.  And it now appears Facebook" - and this is in 2019 they're writing - "Facebook may have inadvertently extracted another bit of critical information:  users' login credentials, stored unencrypted" - meaning unhashed - "on Facebook's servers and accessible to Facebook employees.



"Brian Krebs reports that hundreds of millions of Facebook users had their credentials logged in plaintext by various applications written by Facebook employees.  Those credentials were searched" - and here's the point that - the numbers are just staggering.  Those credentials, right, the Facebook users app login credentials stored in plaintext, Krebs reported at the time, "were searched by about 2,000 Facebook engineers and developers more than nine million times, according to a senior Facebook employee who spoke to Krebs.  The employee asked to remain anonymous because they did not have permission to speak to the press on the matter."  No, I would not think they would have permission.



And of course I recall this from when we talked about it five years ago because those numbers are so outrageous.  So now Ars is reporting five years downstream currently that Facebook has spent these five years, these past five years "investigating" this.  What?  Five years?  A heading in Ars reporting, they now said:  "Meta investigated for five years."  But as I said, this seems to me the term "investigated" should be put in air quotes because it's difficult to see how an "investigation" of non-hashing of login credentials could possibly require anybody five years.



Also, apparently they've got 2,000 engineers who have time to search through their own customers' passwords.  You'd think they'd have some time to do some investigating of how they're, like, why aren't they hashing anything?  How could this take five years is beyond me.  And if anything, over that course of time, whatever trail there was would have only grown more stale year after year as people who knew the details became less accessible and more probably more forgetful, whether conveniently or not.  So this feels a lot like Facebook dragging their feet internally and not wanting to give any final result from their investigation.



But in any event, now Ars reports that Graham Doyle, Ireland's Deputy Commissioner of Data Protection, says:  "It is widely accepted that user passwords should not be stored in plaintext, considering the risks of abuse that arise from persons accessing such data.  It must be borne in mind that the passwords, the subject of consideration in this case, are particularly sensitive, as they would enable access to users' social media accounts."



And of course the other thing we know, unfortunately, is that anybody who is still not using a password manager, and while the percentage of Internet users who today are using password managers has been going up significantly, still it's a minority.  And we know then that there's a high incidence of password reuse.  So passwords stored in plaintext can be used as a starting point for guessing the reuse of those credentials elsewhere.



Anyway, Ireland has been investigating the incident since Meta disclosed it, and their Commission of Data Protection, which is the lead European Union regulator for most U.S. Internet services, finally imposed a fine of $101 million, that's 91 million euros, this past week.  So we can add that to the pile of fines that Facebook has incurred since the EU has been levying fines.  Now, I have to say $101 million is not much compared to the more than $2.23 billion, that's 2 billion euros,  for violations of the General Data Protection Regulation, the famous (or infamous) GDPR, which went into effect in 2018.  So that amount includes last year's record $1.34 billion, which is 1.2 billion euro fine which Meta is now appealing.



So I presume, though I haven't looked into it since it's not frankly that interesting, that these fines - and we talked about them at the time - are due to Facebook storing EU citizen data outside the EU, likely in U.S.-based data centers.  In any event, this is all a mess and demonstrates that, you know, as an industry we're still trying to figure out how to do all this stuff so that everybody's happy.  And we're not there yet.



Okay.  Now we have an action item for a lot of our listeners.  A new, forthcoming PayPal default will be opting all of their customers, their users, into merchant data sharing.  Two weeks ago, PayPal posted a 60-day notice warning of a forthcoming change to their Privacy Statement which will become effective at the end of November, on November 27th. The amendment says, under "Notices/Issued," dated September 23rd, 2024:  "Amendments to the PayPal Privacy Statement," becoming effective November 27th.



And PayPal clearly explained:  "We are updating our Privacy Statement to explain how, starting early Summer of 2025" - so not till next summer - "we will share information to help improve your shopping experience and make it more personalized for you.  The key update to the Privacy Statement explains how we will share information with merchants to personalize your shopping experience and recommend our services to you.  Personal information we disclose includes, for example, products, preferences, sizes, and styles we think you'll like.  Information gathered about you after the effective date of our updated Privacy Statement, November 27th, 2024, will be shared with participating stores where you shop, unless you live in California, North Dakota, or Vermont.  For PayPal customers in California, North Dakota, or Vermont, we'll only share your information with those merchants if you tell us to do so.



"No matter where you live, you'll always be able to exercise your right to opt out of this data sharing by updating your preference settings in your account under 'Data and Privacy.'  We are also making other updates to our Privacy Statement including some additional disclosures related to your right, depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, to ask us for a list of the third parties to which we've disclosed personal information, and to provide other clarifying information."



Okay, now, TechRadar carried the news of this by writing:  "Another week, another online service silently changing its data collection and sharing practices by default."  Now, I will argue, and I'll talk about this in a minute, that PayPal is in a different category, but okay.  TechRadar said:  "The good news is that you still have time to opt out before any of your information gets automatically given away without your consent," which is completely true.



"As per PayPal's policy updates page, issued on September 23rd for U.S. users, the service is set to exchange your data with third-party merchants to 'help improve your shopping experience and make it more personalized for you.'"



LEO:  Yeah, right.



STEVE:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Another way for PayPal to generate revenue, we understand.  TechRadar said:  "Starting in early Summer 2025, the new policy will not just come at the detriment of your privacy - even if you're using the best VPN apps - but PayPal will start gathering data as early as November 27th, 2024."  Which is interesting.  So, right, so they're going to start, they're officially going to start accruing all of the things that their purchasers, their users do, that purchase through PayPal, I guess so that there's a nice chunk of it available to offer when they officially start releasing it, and obviously selling it, this coming summer.



LEO:  Do other credit companies do this?  I mean...



STEVE:  No.



LEO:  No.



STEVE:  No.  And credit companies don't have access the way PayPal has with the merchant sites where they're present.  You know, I use a credit card company, just their backend merchant services, and all they get from me is the minimum amount of information required to transact the credit card purchase, nothing, no other information.  But PayPal has an information-sharing agreement with their merchants as part of all of this.



Anyway, TechRadar said:  "Users appear to be opted in by default, which may be an issue under some privacy regulations like GDPR.  After coming across some U.S.-based accounts complaining about this on Twitter, we decided to check," writes TechRadar, "if that was the case also for people in the UK.  When we accessed privacy settings, the option was automatically toggled on.



"It's also important to bear in mind that the policy changes will not apply in the same ways across all jurisdictions and users.  For instance, in the UK, the new data sharing is set to be enforced on October 10th, 2024."  Which you know, in two days.



LEO:  That's day after tomorrow.  Oh, wow.



STEVE:  Yeah.  "A policy update dated July 8th clarifies that, for the UK market, 'merchants are permitted to share customer personal information provided to them by PayPal with their service providers.'  We suggest checking your profile settings as soon as possible to reverse the change if you don't wish your data to be shared."



Okay, now, I had to read that last part twice.  In the UK, PayPal will be sharing its users' shopping histories with merchants; and, in turn, those merchants will be permitted to share this personal information provided by PayPal with the customers' service providers.  So UK-based ISPs, who are not PayPal merchants, will nevertheless obtain this information indirectly through the merchants who are.



LEO:  Oh, this is disgusting.



STEVE:  It is.



LEO:  It's terrible.



STEVE:  It's unbelievable.  And note that all of these information-sharing activities are pretty much guaranteed to be for-pay arrangements; right?  PayPal is unlikely to be sharing this valuable information with their merchants for free.  Or if it is for free, then it represents an additional inducement for a merchant to offer PayPal payment.  You know, the pitch would be:  "Offer PayPal checkout, and as an added benefit we'll provide you with the detailed buying histories of the people who come to your website."



So as it happens, the people who participate in discussions over in GRC's "think tank" newsgroup know, because I was discussing the pros and cons of it there, that I had recently been considering reducing software purchase friction by adding PayPal checkout to GRC's eCommerce system.



LEO:  Yeah, a lot of Europeans prefer it.



STEVE:  Yes.  I decided not to, in the interest of remaining with a single universal credit card solution, since I've been using that for the past 25 years.  Learning of this, I'm certain that I made the right decision since I would feel uncomfortable using a payment solution that defaults to profiling its users' purchasing.  Since, I mean, that's deeply confidential information.



Now, I have to say I use PayPal myself, but fortunately I'm in California.  And while the "nanny state" nature of California does occasionally annoy me and interfere with my choices, in this case I was glad to find that, indeed, that information sharing switch that almost everyone else will find is ON by default was OFF for me.  For anyone who uses PayPal, after logging in, go to "Settings," which is a gear icon in the upper right if you're using a web browser.  Under "Data & Privacy" you'll find the section "Manage shared info," and within that section you'll see "Personalized Shopping."



If you select that option, you'll be presented with some description and a big switch.  And it says:  "Let us share products, offers, and rewards you might like with participating stores."  And then it says - and then there's a big switch.  Mine was off because I'm in California.  Other people will find theirs on.  "Starting early summer 2025, we'll be building more personal experiences for you.  You can opt in and out of sharing at any time by adjusting this setting."  And then there's a link, "How personalized shopping works."  If you click that, and I have pictures of all this in the show notes, it shows, it says:  "How personalized shopping works.  We're on a mission to help you find the most relevant products and styles."  And it says:  "We'll share recommendations with participating stores based on your shopping history and preferences.  Your info helps participating stores show you products, offers, and rewards you might like."



So, yes, yet another privacy invasion.  This is a new section and option that no PayPal user will have seen before.  TechRadar explained that in the U.S., only residents of California, North Dakota, and Vermont will find this turned off by default, with it being on for everyone else, including those in the United Kingdom.  Underneath that big switch, you know, I explained what it says.



And so, you know, I know how this audience, the audience of this podcast, feels about Internet privacy since I've long enjoyed plenty of two-way communication with our listeners, first through Twitter, now through email.  So I wanted to be sure that everyone using PayPal in the United Kingdom, probably elsewhere in the world, and in the U.S., who does not reside in those three states, knew about PayPal's user purchase data sharing plans in time to preemptively say, gee, thanks, but no thanks.  So flipping that off any time before the end of November will prevent PayPal from ever starting to do this.



So having said all that, I do also want to acknowledge that both this past Sunday, two days ago, and also the Sunday before, PayPal did very clearly notify me through email of these pending changes in a completely aboveboard fashion.  In the identical email I received on those successive Sundays, they wrote: "Our updated Privacy Statement outlines how we'll use info collected about you after November 27th, 2024 to inform participating stores about what products, offers, and rewards you might like."  So, you know, while we know that the "tyranny of the default" will work in their favor, and that defaulting to "opt-in" - defaulting to opt-in - will see most people simply glaze over, delete that email without pursuing it because, you know, we're constantly getting updates about this or that privacy statement being amended.  In fact, during my walk yesterday evening with Lorrie, I mentioned this to her, and she just said, "Yeah, I don't ever read those."  I said, yeah, no one does.



LEO:  Right, yeah.  That's why, I mean, you read your emails.  People go, oh, it's more solicitations.  I don't need it.



STEVE:  Right, exactly.  So anyway, you know, to me this feels extra troublesome because this is a service that I have used simply because I prefer not spreading my credit card number and information around.  It's why I was considering, you know, adopting it for GRC, because I recognize, you know, I see how glad I am when some random merchant I'm going to allows me to pay through PayPal because it is the lower friction transaction.  Unfortunately, PayPal realized, wow, you know, look at all this information that we're getting about the people who use our service.  We could be making some extra money by selling that.  And so unless we say "no thank you," that's what they're going to begin doing.  I knew our listeners would want to know.  And Leo...



LEO:  You should see all the comments in YouTube.  Paul Reed:  "I turned it off.  Thanks, Steve."  John Regan:  "I just turned mine off, too."  Let's see.  Vagita:  "I received the email today but skipped it until your story."  I mean, thank you, Steve, is I guess the general sentiment.  Because, yeah, who reads those emails?



STEVE:  Yup.



LEO:  Do you want to take a break?  Is that what I sense from you?



STEVE:  Yes.



LEO:  Yeah, I would like to take a break right now.  Well, good news, Steve, because we have sponsors.  And they want to tell you about their product; okay?  And by the way, I just want to tell you, we're not like PayPal.  We know nothing about you.  We can't know anything about you.  This is an RSS feed that goes to an IP address, so we don't know who it is.  So don't worry about it, we're not ever going to - we couldn't collect that kind of information.  Unless you join the Club.  And then we don't need to because you're giving us seven bucks a month; right?  Now, let's hear about that DDoS record.  What was the old record?



STEVE:  Oh ho ho ho, baby.  Last Friday, Cloudflare disclosed that it had broken yet another record in fending off the largest DDoS attack ever seen on the Internet.  Though the attack was brief, it lasted only 65 seconds from start to finish, during those 65 seconds Cloudflare's infrastructure was hit by an attack that peaked at 3.8 terabits per second.



LEO:  Whoa.



STEVE:  3.8 trillion bits per second.  So...



LEO:  Don't be reassured by the briefness of this.  That just means they were testing it; right?



STEVE:  Yes.



LEO:  It was just they test the weapon before they point it at somebody.



STEVE:  Yes.  And what was interesting to me, because I saw the graph of this, was how steep the leading and trailing edges were.  You know, I've seen a lot of DDoS attacks myself.  And generally they sort of ramp up to full steam, and then they sort of fade out over time, you know, as the different agents get the news of where they should be attacking.  This attack had really surprisingly sharp edges.  It came on, went like right at full strength, 3.8 terabits per second.  It went for 65 seconds, and then it just shut itself down.  So to me that was really interesting.  Maybe there's a new way these are being staged where, for example, the instructions go out to at this time launch an attack at this target.  Yes.  Now you've got it onscreen.  And that is a sharp...



LEO:  That's an on-off switch.  That's incredible.



STEVE:  Yeah.  It's really interesting.  Yeah, look at that.



LEO:  Wow.



STEVE:  2.1 billion packets per second.



LEO:  Now, they're coming from commandeered machines, from routers?  I mean, it's not just from one guy's machine, obviously.



STEVE:  That's also interesting here.  So I definitely - oh, no, that's not one guy, at all.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  Because you can't, I mean, so the way Cloudflare, the only way Cloudflare is able to fend these off, and it literally, the target of the attack was not affected by this.  Which is astonishing.



LEO:  Mind-boggling, yeah.



STEVE:  You have to think in terms of Cloudflare's ability to absorb the attack.  They're literally, they're absorbing it so that none of their conduits are saturated by that packet rate or that bitrate.  So that valid traffic to the target of the attack is still able to get through Cloudflare's infrastructure and reach the servers that it's protecting.



LEO:  It's a heck of an ad for Cloudflare.



STEVE:  That's, well, yeah.  And in fact I was going to share their disclosure of this, but it was marketing speak.  It was them bragging.  It's like, okay, well...



LEO:  Yeah, it was an ad, yeah.



STEVE:  You know, you do - I'm not saying you don't deserve to brag, but I'm not going to read your advertisement.  So in the last month Cloudflare, which is no stranger to DDoS attacks because it's one of the services they offer, has fended off over 100 of these so-called hyper-volumetric Layer 3 and 4 DDoS attacks, many of which exceeded two billion packets per second.



Now, these so-called hyper-volumetric Layer 3 and 4 DDoS attacks have been occurring since the start of September, and their targets have generally been customers in the financial services, the Internet, and the telecommunications industries who are hiding their servers behind Cloudflare specifically in order to remain on the air despite what would otherwise be wire-melting attack levels.  This recent record-breaking 3.8 terabits per second attack broke the previous record, which had been set nearly three years ago in November of 2021.  That attack peaked at 3.47 terabits per second, this one being at 3.8.



So, you know, we're sort of reaching - you sort of feel like there's a ceiling maybe that we're beginning to hit.  And that one, that November 2021 attack, was blasting an unnamed Asian-based Microsoft Azure customer, trying to blast them off the 'Net.  The attacks are using UDP packets aimed at a fixed port.  And though there wasn't any reporting about this, it turns out that DNS reflection attacks are like what a lot of these DDoS services are using.  The problem is - and that is to say, well, UDP packets bouncing off of DNS servers.  The reason is DNS servers are one of the most prevalent servers that need be publicly accessible in order for their services to be offered.  So they're out there.



So the floods were originating from Vietnam, Russia, Brazil, Spain, and the U.S.  Cloudflare said that the high bitrate attacks likely originate from a large botnet comprising infected ASUS home routers that have been exploited using a recently disclosed critical flaw, which is CVE-2024-3080.  And that's got a CVSS of 9.8.



LEO:  Ouch.



STEVE:  Yeah, that's up there.  According to statistics shared by Censys, you know, that's C-E-N-S-Y-S, which is - it's a new Internet vulnerability apprising service.  It's like Shodan.  Their IPs have reverse-DNS that points to their domain.  And I'm seeing GRC's network being probed by Censys all the time.  That's how I know it's Censys is that their probes identify them.



LEO:  And they're looking for the vulnerability.  Yeah.



STEVE:  Yes, exactly.  In the same way that...



LEO:  Shodan is, yeah.



STEVE:  ...the probes that my own ShieldsUP! port scanner sends out, they have reverse DNS set to shieldsup.grc.com so people who care know that it's, you know, a benign half-open TCP probe.  It doesn't actually connect to anything.



Anyway, Censys said, of this 9.8 ASUS flaw, a little over 157,000 ASUS router models were potentially affected by the vulnerability when they did their scan in June, June 21st of this year, of 2024, with the majority of these devices located in the U.S., Hong Kong, and China.  So DDoS isn't going away.  It's not going to go away.  It is a, you know, we've spent a lot of time over the years talking about DDoS attacks, why they happen and why they are unblockable.



For a long time I was, like in the early days, I was lobbying for ISPs to filter the packets leaving their networks, you know, egress filtering, as it's called, because we had bots that were spoofing their source IPs in order to cause packets to bounce off of some server and go to the target.  And I said, hey, this problem can all be solved if ISPs just won't let these bogus packets that should never originate from within their networks leave their network.  Well, that was then.  What's happened is now we have these Layer 3 and 4 attacks which are very often HTTP queries.  So they're not spoofing their IP because, if you've got hundreds of thousands of bots...



LEO:  Because it's a million ASUS routers.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  Hey, it's me.  What are you talking about?



STEVE:  Yeah, doesn't matter.  And so now the packets leaving are valid, and they're like making very expensive queries of servers that are heavily script laden and take a long time to respond.  And it just - so it's a server CPU exhaustion, where they just can't serve, they can't generate that many high-cost pages. 



LEO:  Now, you mentioned the abrupt on-and-off profile of this attack.



STEVE:  Yeah. 



LEO:  That's interesting because that means you've got a command-and-control server that can trigger all of these routers instantly.



STEVE:  Yeah.  And that's why I'm thinking maybe they are time-synched, and the command is on...



LEO:  Ah, at 3:00 p.m., yeah, yeah.



STEVE:  Yes.



LEO:  Your site was down briefly this week.



STEVE:  Yup.



LEO:  I was wondering if you were hit by DDoS or it was just...



STEVE:  Yup, it was Sunday morning.  It started a little after, like about 9:15, and lasted for an hour.  And it was a flood attack.  And, you know, I just - actually I was working on the podcast, and so I just - and I said, "Lorrie, GRC's down."  And she said, "Oh, no, what are you going to do?"  I said, "Well, I've got Google Docs open.  I'm working on Tuesday's podcast.  So, you know."



LEO:  Nothing.  The answer is nothing.  Steve does not negotiate with terrorists, just so you know.



STEVE:  Well, and it takes, like, nothing to knock me off the 'Net.  I'm not protected.  I'm not hiding.  I don't have Cloudflare.



LEO:  Have you thought of becoming a Cloudflare customer?



STEVE:  No.



LEO:  You're not mission critical.  It's not worth it.



STEVE:  Well, and I'm offering a lot of services for free.  And if I start doing things that cost me money...



LEO:  Right.



STEVE:  Then the whole tradeoff between what I can choose to do and what doesn't make sense begins to change.



LEO:  Right, right.



STEVE:  So...



LEO:  We do have - our servers are behind, I'm not going to be specific about what we do, but we are behind DDoS protection.  Of course, that's one of the things Club TWiT pays for; you know?  We do have some revenue, and so we're able to do that.  Does Cloudflare not offer some sort of free tier?  I believe they do.  But I don't know if it includes DDoS.



STEVE:  So the other thing is that my bandwidth is complex because I'm...



LEO:  Yeah, you're not normal.



STEVE:  ...sending out ShieldsUP packets.  I'm using DNS in order to version checking for all of the freeware that's able to check for different versions.  And it just makes life more complicated.  I believe in keeping it simple when I can.  And, you know, we're mostly on the 'Net.  And when we're not...



LEO:  It's not mission-critical.  That's what I tell my staff.  They say, why don't you have generators?  Because we're not mission-critical.  If we're down for an hour or two, no one's going to die.  Although, you know, since we closed the studio I no longer have anywhere to put my server.  It used to be running in the studio.  So my website, Leo.fm, has been down, as have been the Minecraft servers.  And I think what I'm going to do is use Cloudflare pages to host my website because then you get all those - and it's completely free.  You get all those benefits.  It's a little tricky to set it up.  I've been trying for three months to do it.  But as soon as I figure it out I will do it.  Cloudflare's a pretty impressive service, I have to say.  I will...



STEVE:  I like them.  And, you know, I think Microsoft has a service, Akamai has a service, I mean, there are, you know...



LEO:  Amazon does, yeah, there are a lot of companies that do this, yeah.



STEVE:  Yeah. 



LEO:  They have to have a lot of bandwidth; right?



STEVE:  Well, and so what they have to have is geographic spread.



LEO:  Yes.



STEVE:  So the idea is that there are these bots scattered all over the world, which means they are entering Cloudflare's infrastructure at access points all over the world. 



LEO:  Right.



STEVE:  So even though the total amount of bandwidth is high, the local amount of bandwidth is lower than Cloudflare's bandwidth at that location.  And that's the key is that no part - so Cloudflare is so spread geographically that even though the total attack is huge, there's no saturation, no point of saturation.  Cloudflare's technology allows them to identify and block the attack at all of the different points across its infrastructure before the routing concentrates the attack down to the server where it's being targeted.



LEO:  Perfect.  That's why it's often CDNs that do this.



STEVE:  And that's the key to them.  Yes, exactly, you need a big content delivery network-style protection.  And I've got a wire.  I've got a 100-base-T connection.



LEO:  GRC isn't in 30 countries all over the globe, in every continent?  No?  I don't understand why not.



STEVE:  Okay.  So speaking of these ASUS routers, I use an ASUS router for WiFi service at my place with Lorrie.  And even if that router were not safely perched behind a separate pfSense firewall appliance which connects it to the Internet, the last thing I would ever do would be to open a publicly accessible remote admin portal, or media server, or file server, or any of that nonsense.



LEO:  Right.



STEVE:  Which consumer routers now offer as bullet points for themselves.



LEO:  And a lot of people do it.  They put their Plex server on the network or whatever.



STEVE:  Yeah, like some poor clown at LastPass.



LEO:  [Theatrical throat-clearing]



STEVE:  So I'm sure that listeners of this podcast have similarly protected themselves.  But the Censys survey reveals that around 157,000 other ASUS owners may not have been so circumspect.  You know, so seeing this story, I checked in with my router, which I hadn't for a while.  I don't have automatic updates enabled, although the ASUS allows it, since my network has other security provisions, like, galore.  But it turned out that when I checked, my router's firmware was a bit behind.  It was running v3.0.0.4, and 3.0.0.6 was available.



LEO:  Well, that's not too behind.  That's just...



STEVE:  I have no trouble with the router, but updating always makes sense.  And also having layers of security is always a good thing, so the more the merrier.  Since this month of October is National Cybersecurity Awareness month, let me take this occasion to suggest that everyone listening just take a moment to check their router's firmware to see whether there's an update available beyond what's running now.  I'm glad I did.  And I would recommend that everybody turn on automatic firmware  updating, since that's a feature that is now available in consumer routers, and it just makes sense.



LEO:  You should only have it off if you're Steve Gibson, and you know what you're doing.  I mean...



STEVE:  You know, if you really - essentially, if you're willing to take responsibility for it being off, and you know what that means, and the idea of having your router updating itself for some reason makes you queasy, and I don't think it should.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  So.  We've recently been looking at the growing problem of spoofed identities by remote workers.  The news just this past week is that more than a dozen blockchain companies have inadvertently hired undercover North Korean IT workers.  Because that's what you want in your cryptocurrency companies.  Wow.  You know?  We wonder what is the problem with these blockchain companies?  Why can't they get their security right?  Well, according to a CoinDesk investigation, these companies include well-established blockchain projects such as Injective, ZeroLend, Fantom, SushiSwap, Yearn Finance, and Cosmos Hub.



LEO:  Well-established brand names in crypto space.



STEVE:  All happily employing North Korean IT workers.



LEO:  Wow.



STEVE:  In every case, the workers passed checks using fake IDs and fake job histories.  And, you know, aside from it being an obviously bad idea for any cryptocurrency company to allow an agent of a foreign government inside your sensitive organization, it also happens to be completely against the law in the U.S. and any other companies that have North Korea under sanctions, which include you can't hire anybody who's from North Korea.  Wow.  I guess that's a consequence of everything going virtual.  Unfortunately, you've got virtual employees now, and Korean may be their first language.



LEO:  Yikes.  By the way, I wanted to mention this.  I know you're very interested in bitcoin.  We covered it.  You had some and so forth.  And there's always been a question about the person who invented it.  You did a couple of really good pieces on that.



STEVE:  Satoshi.



LEO:  On the mathematician or group involved behind it, Satoshi Nakamoto.  No one knows who that is, or if he or they are still alive.  But I'm very curious.  Tonight there will be a documentary coming out on HBO, by the same guy who kind of blew the lid off Q, remember, the whole Q thing.  Cullen Hoback is purporting that he knows who Satoshi is, and he will reveal it in this documentary on HBO tonight.  So I'm very curious what that's going to be.  And I guess that's where I'll be tonight, watching that show.



STEVE:  We made some millionaires.



LEO:  Yeah.  And, you know, lately, with the news of this, some of the very earliest bitcoin wallets have been opened and transferred out.  And so there is some thinking that maybe he did come upon the true, I mean, so many people have done this, including Newsweek, announced incorrectly who Satoshi Nakamoto was.  It could just be another one of those.  It could be an Al Capone's safe, or it could be really a big story.



STEVE:  Wasn't there some guy they outed, and he kept saying over and over, I'm not him, please, I'm not him.



LEO:  It was some poor Japanese guy named Satoshi.  Newsweek put it on the cover.  It was not a good - they never - I don't think they ever retracted it, even.  It was just terrible.  Anyway, I'll let you know next week what I think.



STEVE:  Cool.  I'll make a point of watching it.  It sounds fun.



LEO:  It might be worth watching yeah.  This guy absolutely figured out who Q was.  So, and it was a really good documentary.  This one's called "Money Electric:  The Bitcoin Mystery."



STEVE:  Nice.  So Chris said:  "Hi, Steve.  I'm a longtime listener to Security Now!, but last week as I was hiking in the White Mountains," he said, "it occurred to me that there is one episode of this podcast that literally changed my life, and that was the Vitamin D episode."



LEO:  Me, too, I think.  Yeah.  I agree.



STEVE:  And actually many of our listeners have said the same.  He said:  "Ten years ago I would listen to podcasts while lying in bed suffering from debilitating back pain.  My doctor had prescribed a big bottle of opioids, and I was desperate for an alternative, when I heard you and Leo mention Vitamin D and your past episode.  I went back to the archive and listened to the Vitamin D episode, then went to my doctor and made him test me.  My Vitamin D level was extremely low.



"I started taking 4,000 IU daily, and over the course of a year I threw out the pain meds and started to feel much better.  I would likely be bedridden and addicted to painkillers, rather than hiking in New Hampshire, had I not started taking Vitamin D.  I think it's been a couple of years since I heard you mention Vitamin D on the podcast, so I want to urge you to remind people about that episode and your Vitamin D page, in case there is anyone else out there facing a similar situation."



LEO:  And this would be the place where I would mention that neither Steve nor I are medical doctors, and that we, you know, this is not medical advice.



STEVE:  Yes.  I have in the show notes, I said:  "Everyone should keep in mind that I have no formal medical training of any kind.  I'm a self-taught health hobbyist.



LEO:  Which should say something right there.  And Chris's story, while amazing, is purely anecdotal.



STEVE:  Absolutely.



LEO:  However, the good news is Vitamin D is not toxic.  So at worst you're throwing money away; right?



STEVE:  Well, it is toxic at extremely high doses.



LEO:  You have to take a lot of it.



STEVE:  You have to take a lot.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  So it was our audio podcast, actually it was an audio-only podcast, Leo, 209, recorded on August 13th of 2009.  And at the time I had been spending a lot of time researching health and nutrition.  I would take something - a vitamin or a mineral - and read one or more entire books about it, cover to cover.



And I have to say that that research, which was done 20 years ago, before I turned 50, it's had a profound effect upon the lives of myself, my family, and my friends.  I have no way of knowing whether I would feel as fantastic as I do today if I had not been consuming a wide range of supplemental nutrition for the past 20 years.  You know, we'll never know.  But I do know that there's still a lot more that I want to accomplish, so I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing since, if nothing else, it certainly doesn't appear to be hurting.



However, I know that for many people consuming lots of supplements may not be practical for a number of reasons.  Many dislike taking pills.  They can upset stomachs, and there's an added cost, of course, above one's normal diet.  And for that reason, I've been extremely selective, like down to one, about, you know...



LEO:  I keep begging Steve to tell me what else he knows, but he won't tell me.



STEVE:  So, you know, so I've been selective about what I've shared of my research.  I mean, Leo, there's just there's some fascinating things.  But anyway.  I felt compelled to steal an early episode of Security Now! to explain what I had learned about Vitamin D.  What you will find, our listeners who don't already know, will find in that podcast is an explanation of the science and the biochemistry of Vitamin D, why it's not actually a vitamin, and the many reasons why it's so crucial to human health.



And interestingly, this was done in August of 2009.  The spring following that podcast, so the spring of 2010, I started receiving notes from many of our listeners who separately, individually reported that for the first time in their lives they and their family, who were also taking a useful - who had started taking a useful amount of Vitamin D had sailed through the winter months without so much as a sniffle.  And years later we saw an example of Vitamin D's powerful benefits for our immune system during the world's struggle with COVID-19.  Multiple studies revealed - and again, we know that correlation is not causation.  But there was a strong correlation shown between people's Vitamin D status and their COVID outcomes.



So anyway, the reason I chose to talk about Vitamin D is that only micrograms of it are required.  It's extremely potent.  So that means that a useful daily dose of four to 5,000 IU is delivered in a little, tiny, easy-to-swallow capsule of olive oil - or, as I like to refer to them, "little drops of sunshine."  And Vitamin D is also very inexpensive.  About a year's supply is $15.



So anyway, I just - thank you, Chris, for putting this back on everyone's map.  Again, I'll say I have no formal medical training.  I'm just curious about the way my body works.  And I feel a little guilty that there's so much more I could share, but I am self-taught.



LEO:  Can we just - can we have a little private chat sometime, and you can tell me what else I should be doing?



STEVE:  Well, you know, two of my very best friends, my high school buddies, are MDs.  And they're always saying, okay, Steve, what should we be taking?  Because of course...



LEO:  Well, I do C because of you, and megadoses of C.  You do more than I do.  But I do three grams a day.



STEVE:  Yeah, that's not enough.  But it's better than none.



LEO:  It's a lot.



STEVE:  Here's an example, Leo.  There is an enzyme, L-Gulonolactone oxidase.



LEO:  Yes, of course.



STEVE:  I know.  We know the chromosome on the human genome which codes for the creation of that enzyme.  If that enzyme were being created, our livers would be synthesizing, based on our weight, around 20 grams of Vitamin D a day.



LEO:  Whew.



STEVE:  Yes.  And here's the other weird thing is all the other animals in the animal kingdom.



LEO:  They make it.



STEVE:  Yes, except guinea pigs, some fruit bats, and a couple primates that we're very closely related to.  But the dogs and cats that people have as pets, all the animals in the zoo, everything is synthesizing their own Vitamin C because it's so important.  And the other thing is that our liver, our livers are trying to make it.  The first five steps of the synthesis process, it's a six-step process, they're all present and working.  But the lack of that one enzyme causes it to fail.



LEO:  Wow.



STEVE:  And if you inject that enzyme into someone, they suddenly start producing Vitamin D until the enzyme ends up being destroyed over...



LEO:  Vitamin C.



STEVE:  Vitamin C, yeah.



LEO:  We're talking about C now.  We talked about D.  So I put, I have a liquid Vitamin C that's three grams per capful I put in my beverage.



STEVE:  That's, I mean, that's absolutely...



LEO:  But maybe I'll do a couple of those then.



STEVE:  It's absolutely a good thing to do.



LEO:  You think I need 20 grams of Vitamin...



STEVE:  I take 10.  I take five in the morning and five in the evening.



LEO:  That's a lot.  Okay.



STEVE:  It's water soluble, so it doesn't stay with you.



LEO:  It just goes right - that's why I do it in here, in this, because it's titrated.  So I'm sipping all day, so kind of a constant flow of C.  Because it does, it goes right through you.  It doesn't...



STEVE:  That is a good thing.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  And, you know, I know there's lots of people who say, oh, supplements don't do anything, it's just a scam to take your money.  It's like, okay, I get it.  And as I said, I'll never have any proof that I wouldn't be in the same condition I am in.



LEO:  That's the problem, yeah.



STEVE:  If I hadn't been doing this.



LEO:  We don't know if you'd be exactly as you are today having never taken a supplement at all.  There is no way of knowing that.



STEVE:  Right.  



LEO:  By the way, maybe, and they're suggesting this, you and I can get together, we do this little Friday off-the-cuff kind of broadcast where we could talk about the other things that you recommend?  If we had big disclaimers?



STEVE:  The problem is I would have to spend so much time researching it and getting back up to speed, I mean, I think one of the things our listeners like about this podcast is that I'm...



LEO:  It's deeply researched.



STEVE:  I spend a lot of time putting it together.



LEO:  Yeah, yeah.



STEVE:  And I may get around to it.  I mean, get around to doing something more.



LEO:  The invitation's always here.



STEVE:  Thanks.



LEO:  Just so you know.  We have this - Fridays I do kind of an oddball thing.  I'm going to do coffee again.  We did a coffee thing.  It was a lot of fun, cost me huge amounts of money in coffee equipment.  Do you want to take a break?



STEVE:  Yeah, let's do it.



LEO:  Okay.



STEVE:  Perfect.



LEO:  And then we will go on and talk about CUPS.  And I am still very interested in the recommendations for the best routers.  That'll be now, Steve.  On we go.



STEVE:  Shane Overturf, an IT Consultant who listens to the podcast, said:  "Steve, you've probably already seen this article by Akamai regarding the CUPS vulnerability; but in case you haven't, I thought it would be of interest to you."  And he gives me a link.



And he said:  "While it's true that most people aren't going to be exposing port 631 to the Internet" - this is the CUPS vulnerability that we talked about last week - "and I can't think of a valid reason to expose it, it's apparent that there are a fair number of those who do have it exposed.  The Akamai article shows how trivial it is to leverage this vulnerability into a much more serious and widespread attack," he said, "something you alluded to in the last podcast.  So for the devs to dismiss it as 'not so bad' seems to be a dangerous attitude.  Looking forward to Security Now!," he says, "'boldly going where no man has gone before' to 999 and beyond."



So I'm glad that Shane brought this to my attention.  Last week I did note in passing that a handful of other security researchers had also examined the CUPS vulnerability, but I did not bother to dig into them.  Akamai's findings are a bit chilling because they note that the presence of the CUPS-browse service, which is the thing that listens on port 631, allows it to be used in amplifying reflection attacks.



They gave their write-up the title "When CUPS Runneth Over:  The Threat of DDoS."  Akamai wrote:  "Akamai researchers have confirmed a new attack vector using CUPS that could be leveraged to stage distributed denial-of-service attacks.  Research shows that, to begin the attack, the attacking system only needs to send a single packet to a vulnerable and exposed CUPS service with Internet connectivity.



"The Akamai Security Intelligence and Response Team (SIRT) found that more than 198,000 devices" - so just shy of 200,000 devices - "are vulnerable to this attack vector and are accessible on the public Internet.  Roughly one third of those, 34% of those could be used for DDoS abuse," they said, "58,000-plus.  Of the 58,000-plus vulnerable devices, hundreds exhibited an 'infinite loop' of requests.  The limited resources required to initiate a successful attack highlights the danger.  It would take an attacker mere seconds to co-opt every vulnerable CUPS service currently exposed on the Internet and cost the attacker less than a single U.S. cent on modern hyperscale platforms.



"While reviewing the technical write-up about the vulnerabilities, we discovered that another attack vector was not discussed:  DDoS.  DDoS continues to be a viable attack vector used to harass and disrupt victims across the Internet, from major industries and governments to small content creators, online shops, and gamers.  Although the original analysis focused on the RCE - the Remote Code Execution - which could have a more severe outcome, DDoS amplification is also easily abused in this case.



"The problem arises when an attacker sends a crafted packet specifying the address of a target as a printer to be added.  For each single packet sent, the vulnerable CUPS server will generate a larger and partially attacker-controlled IPP/HTTP request directed at the specified target.  As a result, not only is the target affected, but the host of the CUPS server also becomes a victim, as the attack consumes its network bandwidth and CPU resources.  



"We should note that many of these identified machines were running" - get this - "on very old versions of CUPS, such as version 1.3, which was initially released in 2007.  It is not uncommon for some organizations to leave machines running on extremely outdated hardware and software, and it is unlikely that such devices will be updated anytime soon.  This presents a prime opportunity for malicious threat actors.  They can take advantage of the outdated hardware for DDoS amplification or, given the RCE in this scenario, build botnets for many purposes, including DDoS."  So yes, as we say, vulnerabilities and exploits never get worse, they only ever get better.



Oh, and to the issue of consumer routers, a listener who requested anonymity wrote:  "Hello, Steve.  I've been listening to your show for a few years, thanks to the recommendations of my former coworker.  I am following more than I could at first and think I catch the general gist, but still miss significant bits of the technical know-how.  Could you please recommend what is the most secure out-of-the-box residential router for non-technical folks, please?  I want to replace my parents' router for multiple reasons, primarily since I can longer access the online admin portal to update the firmware, which is HTTP, and concerns about TP-Link on the backend. I've heard suggestions, such as use pfSense, but I've also heard that it would be easy to misconfigure something.



"I'm in a non-technical role, and I might be able to follow a YouTube video potentially, but I'm concerned about missing configurations.  Would greatly appreciate it if you or the community could please recommend a budget-friendly residential router that is secure by default without needing end-user configuration.  Thank you."  And then she finished, "I'd appreciate not having my name mentioned on the show."



LEO:  I think that's really a great question because you're a sophisticated user.  You can run pfSense, and maybe many of our audience members are.  But I think it's - for instance, people say, why don't you host your own password vault?  And I'm not an expert on this.  Bitwarden is.  I let Bitwarden do it.  And I think even though it's not Trust No One, it's safer to do that.  I wish I had your skills, but I don't.  So it's appropriate, I think, for somebody to say, well, what's a safe, effective solution that doesn't require a lot of tweaking and fiddling and knowledge?



STEVE:  Right.  And that's exactly the case.  And I liked this listener's question because I believe that today's mainstream consumer routers are all going to be secure by default.



LEO:  Well, that's good news.



STEVE:  And, you know, after enabling automatic firmware updates, which today's routers have, that will keep themselves updated in the event of anything significant happening.  Now, having said that, disabling UPnP and WPS, which are the two things that are generally enabled by default, that's a good idea, too.  But my point here that consumers primarily get into trouble when they enable the additional extra fancy features that are being promoted to sell these routers today; things like remote WAN-side admin or any sort of Internet accessible media, file, or other types of servers.  A media server, a file server or anything like that.



We've seen over and over and over there is no safe and secure way to do any of that.  There are secure ways to accomplish those things, but they're more complex.  They're more complex because more complexity is required to do those things securely.  So in other words, don't do them at all unless you're going to do them the right way.  Don't just flip a switch in your router to turn that stuff on.  That's where you get into trouble.



So, you know, in this case our listener's parents, for whom she's getting this router, they don't need any of that crap.  They need a NAT router.  And, you know, NAT is secure unless you do something to make it insecure.  Unfortunately, UPnP can make it insecure, and WPS can make it insecure.  They just need a generic SOHO (Small Office Home Office) NAT router.  I'm partial to ASUS, and I don't think I'd look any further than that since something in ASUS's line would likely be a good match.  You know, I just looked at Amazon last night because I was curious.  There's a nice-looking ASUS WiFi router for $66.  You know, so that's definitely budget-friendly.



And the ASUS firmware supports disabling WPS and UPnP.  It offers isolated WiFi guest networks, so that you can put your guests and your IoT devices on a network isolated from the rest of the Intranet.  Also a listener of ours, Michael Horowitz, maintains a terrific website over at routersecurity.org, all just one word, R-O-U-T-E-R-S-E-C-U-RI-T-Y, routersecurity.org.  And I recommend Michael's site without reservation for any additional router security research someone would want to do.



LEO:  It's really a short list.  I think this is exactly what I've recommended for years.



STEVE:  Yup.  Yup.



LEO:  I used to have a five-step thing I did on the radio show.  Before you use any wireless router change the password, the administrative password.  Change the default SSID.  Turn on WPA2 encryption.  As you said, turn off WPS and turn off UPnP.  And you're pretty good right there.  You've got some other things to do, like look for port-forwarding and make sure that that's not turned on.



STEVE:  But again, it won't be by default.



LEO:  Right, right.



STEVE:  So, yeah.



LEO:  And I do think that that recommendation now that we make nowadays, which is turn on auto updates and make sure it's doing that, has become more and more important.  Stacey Higginbotham, for a long time, our IoT expert, said don't buy any IoT device that will not automatically wirelessly update because you're going to need updates.  There is no device that's perfect.  And if you turn those updates, if it has the updates in the first place, and you turn them on, that's pretty good.  You agree?



STEVE:  Yup.  I think that's right.  And so I guess the main thing I wanted to say was that when we talked about the ASUS 9.8 CVSS problem, well, that was because somebody turned on one of those extra features.  That's where you get into trouble.  An out-of-the-box ASUS router is a strong NAT router.  It's going to be fine.



LEO:  And if you turn on automatic updates, you wouldn't have had that problem either; right?



STEVE:  Right.



LEO:  That would automatically fix it.  The other thing I love about ASUS is they use their own customized version of DD-WRT, which is an open source router firmware.  You can put DD-WRT on your ASUS router, as well.  And that's nice because, again, open source means there are a lot of eyes looking at it, lot of people working at it, and a lot of fixes out there.  Yeah, I agree with you on ASUS.  We use Ubiquiti.  We've always used Ubiquiti as a kind of a prosumer home system here.



STEVE:  Yeah, Michael likes Peplink, pep something, but it's like a $300 router, and it's - he thinks it's more secure.



LEO:  Synology makes excellent routers, too, by the way.



STEVE:  Yes, Synology's got some nice routers, too.



LEO:  If you want to pay the - honestly, all the good routers, including ASUS now, are well over $200.  $300 is not an unusual amount of money.  Used to be you could buy a $59 Linksys router. That route is pretty much shut down, as it should be.



STEVE:  Well, and the reason is they've - a lot of them are all these fancy gaming things, and they've got quality of service and...



LEO:  And 18 antennas.



STEVE:  And, yeah.  I just think there's a lot of stuff you're paying for that most people don't need.  And I would say that our listener's parents, who just need something for their home, I'd spent 66 bucks for that bottom-of-the-barrel ASUS.  There's nothing wrong with it.



LEO:  Does ASUS have a $66 router?



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  That's good to know.  The other thing I would add, we often come across this on The Tech Guy, is that larger installations, bigger homes, mesh systems are often a good way to go.  And Eero makes a very good, a very easy-to-use mesh system with excellent security, as well.  So if you do need more than - sometimes a single ASUS in the middle of the house isn't enough to get to the corners.



STEVE:  And what do they call it, AI mesh, ASUS has a whole, a very mature mesh technology.



LEO:  They do have a mesh system, yeah, yeah.  Actually, that wouldn't be bad, either.  I haven't tried it, but I'm sure it's good.  ASUS is good, yeah.



STEVE:  Okay.  We're at our main topic, uBlock Origin and Manifest V3.  Why don't we take our last break, and then we will do this unbroken.



LEO:  Which was the name of Kevin Rose's, as you may remember, Kevin Rose's hacker podcast for a long time, The Unbroken.  So this is a subject I've been very interested in for some time because Google's move towards Manifest V3 seems to be very self-serving and may be enough for me to abandon using Chrome.



STEVE:  Well, we talked about it before, and it is the case that it's more secure.  But it comes at the cost of neutering features of the add-ons that many of us have come to rely on.



LEO:  A beneficent side effect, one might say.



STEVE:  Yeah.  So it's been several years since we talked about this, you know, the web browser content blocker that's heavily favored by the Internet's more tech-savvy users.  It's what many of the listeners to this podcast, and you and I, Leo, are using.  I have it installed everywhere possible.  And I've often commented, when I see unfiltered websites, like other people are using a browser...



LEO:  How do you use that stuff?



STEVE:  I can't imagine, I mean, like stuff's jumping up and down, and things are popping up and sliding across the screen, and I just - I cannot imagine not having uBlock Origin filtering the mess that the Internet has become.



LEO:  I mean, we're ad supported.  I'm not against ads.  Ads are vital to the ecosystem.  But there's ads, and then there's ADS.  And some of this is a security issue, as well.



STEVE:  Yeah, the little monkeys jumping up and down with the barbells, it's crazy.



LEO:  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.



STEVE:  So unfortunately, web browsers are gradually tightening the screws on the freedoms that add-on extensions such as uBlock Origin have traditionally enjoyed and upon which they depend.  The Chrome browser's eventual shift from Manifest V2, you know, version 2 to version 3 promises to make life much more difficult, if not impossible, for add-ons like uBlock Origin to continue to provide the features we've grown to depend upon.



And there's been some recent interesting turbulence involving uBlock Origin, Mozilla, and uBlock Origin's cantankerous creator and developer and maintainer, whose real-world name is Raymond Hill.  He goes by the moniker "Gorhill."  And we'll get to the recent trouble between Mozilla and Gorhill in a minute where some seven million installations of uBlock Origin are currently installed.  But let's first look at what's going on with uBlock Origin and the future of the Chrome browser, which has around 37 million installations.



The Neowin site recently published a nice summary with the background titled "uBlock Origin developer recommends switching to uBlock Lite as Chrome flags the extension."  So Neowin wrote:  "Google recently released Chrome 127 into the Stable Channel, and the update caused some commotion among certain customers.  Those using the uBlock Origin extension, one of the most popular and well-received adblockers, noticed that the browser now flags the extension with the following message.  It says:  'uBlock Origin:  This extension may soon no longer be supported.  Remove or replace it with similar extensions from the Chrome Web Store.'"



They wrote:  "Makers of the uBlock Origin extension [meaning Gorhill] published an article on GitHub that explained why Google Chrome claims uBlock Origin 'may soon no longer be supported.'  Long story short," they wrote, "the message appears due to Google's plans to deprecate Manifest V2-based extensions in favor of Manifest V3.  For those unfamiliar," they said, "Manifest is a set of rules that defines how extensions integrate into browsers and interact with their web pages.  Migration from Manifest V2 to V3 has been long in the making.  It faced tremendous criticism from users and developers, forcing Google to delay its plans and implement various changes to address the complaints.



"Despite multiple changes, Manifest V3 still imposes significant limitations on browser extensions, especially content blockers.  There is no Manifest V3-based uBlock Origin, so the developer recommends uBlock Origin Lite, a 'pared-down' Manifest V3-compliant version of the extension.  Like uBlock Origin, uBlock Origin Lite prioritizes reliability and efficiency, but it has to compromise some features that are now impossible under Manifest V3.  There's a dedicated web page that describes the difference between uBlock Origin and uBlock Origin Lite.



"Since the switch to Manifest V3 cripples the extension quite a lot, the developer does not plan to implement an automatic upgrade in the Chrome Web Store."  Basically, these are separate products.  It doesn't make any sense for uBlock Origin the full version to upgrade to the Lite version.  Gorhill's not going to do that.  "Therefore, users can either stick to it until the bitter end or," they write, "look for Manifest V3-compliant alternatives, such as uBlock Origin Lite or others."



Okay.  So on this point Gorhill wrote:  "Manifest V2 uBlock Origin will not be automatically replaced by Manifest V3 uBlock Origin Lite. uBlock Origin Lite is too different from uBlock Origin for it to silently replace uBlock Origin."  He said:  "You will have to explicitly make a choice as to which extension should replace uBlock Origin according to your own prerogatives.  Ultimately, whether uBlock Origin Lite is an acceptable alternative to uBlock Origin is up to you.  It's not a choice that will be made for you."  And we have to say that that's sort of a refreshing approach; right?  After we saw...



LEO:  Kasparov...



STEVE:  Yes, thank you.



LEO:  Not Kasparov, Kaspersky.



STEVE:  Kaspersky.



LEO:  Or Kaspersky.



STEVE:  After we saw Kaspersky just automatically give people a replacement and surprise them, thinking that their computers have been infected with malware.



LEO:  Is better.  You like this.



STEVE:  So anyway, Neowin's coverage finishes, saying:  "According to the most recent announcement, Google plans to finish the migration to Manifest V3 by the end of this year, 2024.  However," they said, "enterprise customers will have the ability to continue using Manifest V2" - the ones we want - "extensions for an additional six months.  Interestingly, Mozilla, the only mainstream browser maker that does not use Chromium" - I suppose that's true if you ignore Apple browsers - they wrote, "does not plan to ditch Manifest V2 extensions."  In other words, we can stay with what we want on Firefox.  They said:  "Therefore, uBlock Origin will continue working in Firefox and other browsers that do not deprecate V2 extensions."



Okay.  So although Chrome is reported to already be deprecating Manifest V2 in favor of V3, I just checked, and my Chrome is running the full uBlock Origin without any complaint.  But that might not last long since Google has said it will be finished with this migration three months from now.  In Google's own Manifest V2 support timeline document, which I tracked down, they wrote:  "On June 3rd of this year, 2024, the Manifest V2 phase-out begins."



They said:  "Starting on June 3rd, which was the date of this announcement, on the Chrome Beta, Dev, and Canary channels, if users still have Manifest V2 extensions installed, some will start to see a warning banner when visiting their extension management page."  Okay, and everybody can do that now, anybody with Chrome.  "Up in the URL put chrome://extensions.  That informs them that some Manifest V2 extensions they have installed will soon no longer be supported.  At the same time, extensions with the Featured badge that are still using Manifest V2 will lose their badge."



So reading that, I fired up my Chrome, which I don't normally have running any longer, and went over to chrome://extensions.  And sure enough, there it was.  For uBlock Origin it said:  "This extension may soon no longer be supported.  Remove or replace it with similar extensions."  And then a link to the Chrome Web Store.  And also down below, where it specifically shows the uBlock Origin little red shield icon, there's a link to "Find alternative."  Okay, I didn't do any of that, and I'll tell you why in a second.



So Google said:  "This will be followed gradually in the coming months by the disabling of those extensions.  Users will be directed to the Chrome Web Store, where they will be recommended Manifest V3 alternatives for their disabled extension.  For a short time after the extensions are disabled, users will still be able to turn their Manifest V2 extensions back on, but over time that toggle will go away, as well."  So they're trying to softly force everyone off of V2 extensions.  But eventually, like by turning them off, then you can go back and turn it on if you want to, then they'll turn it off again, so you can fight with Chrome that way for a while.



And they said:  "Like any big launches, all these changes will begin in pre-stable channel builds of Chrome first - Beta, Dev, and Canary.  These changes will be rolled out over the coming months to Chrome Stable, with the goal of completing the transition by the beginning of next year, meaning 2025."



And that timeline document ended with the statement:  "Enterprises using the ExtensionManifestV2Availability policy will be exempt from any browser changes until June of 2025."  Well, that, I thought, was interesting.  What's this "ExtensionManifestV2Availability" policy, and where can I get one?  So I tracked that down.  It applies to Windows, Mac, and Linux builds of Chrome, the desktop versions.  Google's description for the policy, Google's, you know, the maker of Chrome, their description of the policy is:  "Control if Manifest V2 extensions can be used by browser."  Which sounds like exactly what we want.



So the details are, they said, under their description of this policy:  "Manifest V2 extensions support will be deprecated, and all extensions need to be migrated to V3 in the future.  More information and timeline of the migration can be found at" blah blah blah.  "If the policy is set to Default, or not set, V2 extensions loaded are decided by browser, following the timeline above."  Not quite well written, but fine.  "If the policy is set to Disable" - that's setting number one - "V2 extension installations are blocked.  Existing ones are disabled.  The option is going to be treated the same as if the policy is not set after V2 support is turned off by default."  Meaning you could do it now if for some reason you wanted to, or if your corporation did it to you or something.



"If the policy is set to Enable" - that's setting two - "V2 extensions are allowed.  The option is going to be treated the same as if the policy is not set before V2 support is turned off by default."  In other words, you get to keep them.  Then they said:  "Extensions' availability are still controlled by other policies."  So we have 0 is the default, 1 is they're disabled, 2 is they're enabled, and 3 is that they're enabled for forced extensions only.



Chrome's "forced extensions," as a reminder, are those that are installed by enterprise policy.  They're installed silently without user interaction, bypassing the normal installation process, and they're not removable by users.  So setting this to two sounds like exactly what we want.  That gives any savvy Chrome users an additional six months of access to their current V2 extensions, not just uBlock Origin by anything else that you might want which is sensitive to this V2/V3 switchover.



For Windows systems, this policy can be applied by adding a 32-bit DWORD value to the Windows registry.  It can be done by hand or by executing a .REG registry file.  And you know this is coming; right?  To make this as easy and foolproof as possible for our listeners, I've created a GRC shortcut which will allow you to instantly obtain a three-line, it's very simple, registry file from me.  So the shortcut is grc.sc/v2.  That will offer your browser a file to download named "V2Extension.reg."  You can open it in a text editor to verify its contents or to get, if you want to do it by hand, which you're certainly welcome to, to get the exact spelling of everything because that's got to be exactly right.  Either way, you can double-click on the file to execute it.



Since the file has come to you from the Internet, it will carry the "Mark of the Web," which will cause Windows to scrutinize it further.  Since .REG files are just text files, I cannot digitally sign that.  So I was unable to give it GRC's blessing.  So Windows will inform you that the source of the file cannot be verified, and ask if you're sure.  Once you say, "Yeah, it's okay, I know that guy," you'll get another pop-up, this time from the Registry Editor explaining that running .REG files can mess things up, and that you should only proceed if you know and trust the source of the file and you're sure you want to continue.  If you click "Yes," your system will have added a policy to Chrome instructing it to continue allowing Manifest V2 extensions to run without harassment until next summer.



A cool thing you can do, either before or after, actually it'd be fun to do it both, is there's a different URL you can put into Chrome, chrome://policy.  That will show you any policies that are set in Chrome.  I didn't have any before.  After I ran this registry tweak, sure enough, there it displayed the policy that was in place.  And when I went back to chrome://extensions, that warning message about uBlock Origin was gone.  So Chrome is no longer nervous about me running a V2 extension.  And now I get to keep uBlock Origin for Chrome, not that I use Chrome very much.  But sometimes I do.  I get to keep it until June of 2025.  Yup, and there that is, the "Are you sure you want to do it?"



LEO:  Good.  So now I'm safe on Windows.



STEVE:  Yup.



LEO:  Not so much anywhere else, but...



STEVE:  No.  The same policy is available on Mac and Linux.



LEO:  Ah.



STEVE:  There they call it a "preference."  And I didn't track down how to set a Chrome browser preference.



LEO:  Yeah.  We'll figure that out.



STEVE:  But it is available on all of the desktop platforms.



LEO:  Good to know.  Thank you, Steve.  That's great. 



STEVE:  Yeah.  Okay.  So this brings us back to the question:  "What features does V2-compatible uBlock Origin sacrifice in the transition to V3-compatible uBlock Origin Lite?  Because after June of 2025 Chrome and all Chromium-based browsers...



LEO:  Well, that's the question.  Do they all have to do it?  Like does Brave have to do it?  Does Arc have to do it?  I mean, these are all - Edge?



STEVE:  It looks like Edge is going to be terminating V2 support.  Brave, I have learned from one of our listeners, appears to be willing to go to some effort to continue with V2 support.  So I think we'll be a little bit on pins and needles.



LEO:  Possible, anyway.



STEVE:  Well, maybe.  I mean, it is pretty core to the Chromium architecture.  It may be that they're not going to rip out V2.  They're just going to, like in Chrome, they'll shut it down but leave it there.  So Brave may be able to turn it back on.  It's just we don't know at this point.



Okay.  So the questions are, what's happening?  The uBlock Origin Lite GitHub repository has an FAQ page which answers this question in some detail, and actually with lots of technical jargon.  Wikipedia actually offers a more accessible summary.  So here's what Wikipedia says.  They said:  "In 2023, Google made changes known as 'Manifest V3' to the WebRequest API used by adblocking and privacy extensions to block and modify network connections.  Following Google's implementation of Manifest V3 and the end of support for V2, uBlock Origin's effectiveness is drastically reduced in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers."



Okay.  And I'll just interject that, while this sounds bad, and is, this is not any failing in uBlock Origin.  It's true universally for all content control add-ons under MV3.  This is why Google has been met with significant pushback, and why, for example, the EFF is apoplectic.



Anyway, Wikimedia elaborates.  They wrote:  "As a result, uBlock Origin Lite was created and designed to comply with Manifest V3 extension framework.  uBlock Origin Lite differs significantly from uBlock Origin in several key aspects, primarily due to the constraints and design goals associated with MV3.  Specifically, it lacks filter list updates outside of extension updates, and has no custom filters, strict-blocked pages, per-site switches, or dynamic filtering.  Non-Chromium browsers," they wrote, "such as Firefox are unaffected.  Google has been criticized for implementing some of these features due to its dominance in the online advertising market."



Gorhill's FAQ page for uBlock Origin Lite asks and answers this question.  Question:  "If I install uBlock Origin Lite, will I see a difference from uBlock Origin?"  And his answer:  "Maybe.  Maybe not.  It depends on websites you visit, how you configured uBlock Origin, and how you configured uBlock Origin Lite."  And he says:  "In short, only you can tell."  He says:  "It's very possible that the sites you visit do not require any of the filtering capabilities specific to uBlock Origin, in which case you won't see a difference.



"Also, mind that by default there's no cosmetic filtering or scriptlet injection in uBlock Origin Lite, while these occur by default in uBlock Origin.  In uBlock Origin Lite, you will have to raise the blocking mode to either Optimal or Complete to benefit from cosmetic filtering and scriptlet injection.  Furthermore, uBlock Origin Lite requires the default mode to be Optimal or Complete for some advanced filtering capabilities to take effect, while they're enabled by default in uBlock Origin.  In general, uBlock Origin Lite will be less effective at dealing with websites using anti-content blocking, or minimizing website breakage."



Okay.  So it doesn't sound like the end of the world for uBlock Origin Lite on Chrome, which Chrome users will at least be able to delay using now, using this policy change, until June of 2025.  So that's the story with Chrome and all the closely related Chromium-based web browsers.  The great news for the seven million of us who are currently using the full uBlock Origin on Firefox is that Mozilla has officially stated that they have no plans to remove support for Manifest V2 from Firefox.



LEO:  Oh, that's great.



STEVE:  And Leo, as you said, you know, that's going to put some pressure, I think, on people who really do care about controlling their Internet browsing experience.



LEO:  They should have been using Firefox all along, anyway, in my opinion.



STEVE:  Yes, agreed.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  Yeah.  So the good news is Mozilla has no plans to do the same for Firefox.  Okay.  However, uBlock Origin is so popular and well known that a recent kerfuffle between Mozilla and Gorhill regarding uBlock Origin Lite received a great deal of attention online.  There's a bunch of coverage of it in the tech press.  A bunch of our listeners said, hey, what's this about?  Can you figure this out?



So, okay.  You may be thinking, did I say Mozilla and uBlock Origin Lite?



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  And if so, why is there a Lite edition of uBlock Origin on Firefox when Mozilla has said that Firefox's support for Manifest V2 is safe and will never be removed?  The reason is that Gorhill just wanted to release the same add-on feature-set for Firefox and Manifest V3 that he had created for Chrome.  He wanted to have a uBlock Origin Lite available for both major web browser platforms.



A little over a month ago, Gorhill posted to GitHub that he had received two emails from Mozilla Add-Ons, you know, addons.mozilla.org, also known as AMO, you know, the abbreviation of that domain, addons.mozilla.org.  And he posted the entire content of the emails that he had received.



Mozilla Add-Ons wrote:  "Hello.  Your Extension uBlock Origin Lite was manually reviewed by the Mozilla Add-ons team in an assessment performed on our own initiative of content that was submitted to Mozilla Add-ons.  Our review found that your content violates the following Mozilla policy or policies.  First, consent, specifically, nonexistent:  For add-ons that collect or transmit user data, the user must be informed and provided with a clear and easy way to control this data collection.  The control mechanism must be shown at first-run of the add-on.



"The control should contain a choice accompanied by the data collection summary.  Depending on the type of data being collected, the choice to send cannot be enabled by default.  If data collection starts or changes in an add-on update, or the consent and control is introduced in an update, it must be reshown to all new and upgrading users.  For the exact requirements, refer to" - and then they have a URL.  "For an example of how to provide a consent and control dialog, see" - and another URL.  "Also, if your add-on is listed on addons.mozilla.org, the listing needs to include a privacy policy, and a summary of the data collection should be mentioned in the add-on description."



LEO:  You can't blame Mozilla for saying that; right?  I mean...



STEVE:  Right.  Yeah, absolutely.



LEO:  But Gorhill probably doesn't want to do that.



STEVE:  Well, yes.  And so point number two, they wrote:  "Sources, specifically Sources or instructions are missing."  They wrote:  "Your add-on contains minified, concatenated, or otherwise machine-generated code.  You need to provide the original sources, together with instructions on how to generate the exact same code used in the add-on.  Source code must be provided as an archive and uploaded," blah blah blah blah blah.  Okay.  And this refers to a bazillion affected versions.  He's got, like I can't even count, like I don't know, like a huge number of affected versions.



LEO:  Well, that's reasonable, too, because if there's hidden code in there...



STEVE:  Completely reasonable.  Completely reasonable.  So, and the second email listed exactly the same add-on policy failures, none of which applied to uBlock Origin Lite, or uBlock Origin, for that effect.  But that one only showed the oldest of the versions and gave him 14 days to cure the problem.  The other ones immediately yanked all of those previous ones including the most recent one from the add-ons site, the Mozilla add-ons.



Gorhill predictably reply wrote in the thread, he said:  "Contrary to what these emails suggest, the source code files highlighted in the email have nothing to do with data collection.  There is no such thing anywhere in uBlock Origin Lite.  There is no minified code in uBlock Origin Lite, and certainly none in the supposed faulty files.  There is a privacy policy link in uBlock Origin Lite's add-on page," meaning these manually reviewed emails were 100% bogus.  Like whoever did this couldn't have actually looked at what was being supplied.  They probably assume that every add-on now is doing data collection.  And so when they saw that this thing didn't pop up a data collection notification, they said, oh, it's missing.  Well, yes.



LEO:  But Gorhill doesn't collect any data?



STEVE:  None whatsoever.  Zero.



LEO:  All right.



STEVE:  That's not what uBlock Origin does; right?



LEO:  Right.



STEVE:  I mean, he's old-school.  He's, you know, he's one of us.



LEO:  But could it be said you're collecting data if, I mean, I wonder if some of the activities of an adblocker kind of imply that maybe you have to look at the this - for instance, you might have to look at the site somebody's visiting to know what extension to enable.  Or there may be, it may be that in fact the extension sees the sites that you're visiting, in which case there is a theoretical possibility of data collection; right?



STEVE:  Well, that's why he provides the source.  And we've talked about this.  Firefox requires that you provide the full source, no minification, and instructions on how to build it from scratch.  So that it's like...



LEO:  Good.



STEVE:  Yeah.  I mean, they've done everything right.  Unfortunately, they have accused Gorhill of using minified code, no ability to build it, and data collection, none of which is true.



LEO:  So he doesn't do any of that.



STEVE:  Doesn't do any of that.



LEO:  He doesn't minify code?



STEVE:  No.



LEO:  Oh, so this was some automated thing that didn't know what the hell it was talking about.



STEVE:  It was completely bogus.  It was completely bogus.  And the problem is you don't give bogus stuff to Gorhill.



LEO:  Not to Gorhill.  No, no.



STEVE:  So he responds:  "I don't have the time or motivation to spend time on this nonsense, so I will let AMO do whatever they want with uBlock Origin Lite."



LEO:  Oh, lord.



STEVE:  "I will probably publish a self-hosted version which auto-updates, like how dev build of uBlock Origin is self-hosted, when I find the time to arrange all that."  Okay.  So that was his first posting.  The following day, on September 5th, someone with the handle "Rob-W" posted in this discussion thread over on GitHub, he said:  "@gorhill The review decision looks inaccurate to me.  Could you reply to the email to let the original reviewers know that the assessment is inaccurate?  What you wrote above in the comment is sufficient."  Gorhill did not reply to that in the thread.  But nearly two weeks later...



LEO:  I don't know who Raymond Hill is.  I see him as something like Ted Kaczynski, in a shack somewhere with a really long beard.



STEVE:  Like I said, if Dvorak wrote code.



LEO:  This would be...



STEVE:  What are you talking about?



LEO:  God bless him, and we are very grateful.  And, you know, I don't blame him for not wanting to engage in bureaucratic back-and-forth.



STEVE:  That's just exactly it.  So two weeks go by.  And on September 18th Gorhill posted:  "Starting with uBlock Origin Lite," and it was 2024.9.12.1004, "the Firefox version of the extension will be self-hosted and can be installed from the release section.  The extension will auto update when a newer version is available."



And then, on September 26th, Gorhill posted that he had changing his mind.  He wrote:  "The Firefox version of uBlock Origin Lite will cease to exist.  I am dropping support because of the added burden of dealing with AMO's nonsensical and hostile review process.  However trivial this may look to an outsider, it's a burden I don't want to take on; since the burden is on me, I make the decision whether I can take it on or not.  It's not something up for discussion."



He said:  "The burden is that even as a self-hosted extension, it fails to pass review at submission time, which leads to having to wait an arbitrary amount of time, where time is an important factor when all the filtering rules must be packaged into the extension.  And once I finally receive a notification that the review cleared, I have to manually download the extension's file, rename it, then upload it to GitHub, then manually patch the update URL to point to the new version.  It took five days after I submitted version 2024.9.12.1004 to finally be notified that the version was approved for self-hosting.  As of writing, version 2024.9.22.986 has still not been approved.



"However often I look at all this, every time I can only conclude the feedback from Mozilla Add-ons Team to have been nonsensical and hostile, and as a matter of principle I won't partake in this nonsensical and hostile review process."



LEO:  I can't say I blame him.



STEVE:  "It only takes only a few seconds to see how this is nonsensical.  Keep in mind that this 'was manually reviewed by the Mozilla Add-ons team'."  And then he says, he quotes them:  "For add-ons that collect or transmit user data, the user must be informed and provided with a clear and easy way to control this data collection."  And then he says:  "Where is the 'data collection' in this file?"  And he provides the URL to the JavaScript of his code  Then he quotes them again.  "Your add-on contains minified, concatenated, or otherwise machine-generated code."  And then he says again, "Where is the 'minification' in these files?"  And then he gives us four URLs to the open source JavaScript of his code.



Then he quotes them again:  "Also, if your add-on is listed on addons.mozilla.org, the listing needs to include a privacy policy, and a summary of the data collection should be mentioned in the add-on description."  And he said:  "Right.  It's always been there since the first version published on AMO more than a year ago."



LEO:  Oh dear.



STEVE:  And then he gives us the URL.  And he said:  "Incidentally, all the files reported as having issues are exactly the same files being used in uBlock Origin for years, and have been used in uBlock Origin Lite as well for over a year with no modification.  Given this, it's worrisome what could happen to uBlock Origin in the future given it uses the exact same files."  He says:  "Steps taken by Mozilla Add-ons Team as a result of the (nonsensical) 'issues' was to disable all versions of uBlock Origin Lite except for the oldest version, first published by AMO on August of 2023.  That oldest version is also reported as having the same 'issues' and was set to be disabled by Mozilla Add-ons Team unless the 'issues' were addressed."  He said:  "Based on that finding, those versions of your extension will be disabled in 14 days."



So he wrote:  "I disabled this version myself to prevent new users from ending up with a severely outdated version of the extension to avoid a subpar first experience of uBlock Origin Lite.  So essentially," he says, "it was deemed that all versions of uBlock Origin Lite were having 'issues.'  But instead of disabling all of them except the most recent one, they disabled all of them except the oldest one.  This is hostile, considering that whoever installed uBlock Origin Lite at that point would be installing a version of uBlock Origin Lite with severely outdated filter lists, along with an outdated codebase."  He said:  "Many issues were fixed in the codebase since August 2023.



"I am unable to attribute good faith to both the nonsensical review feedback and the steps taken as a result of this nonsensical review feedback, and I am unable to take on the added burden of having to deal with nonsense.  This is unfortunate because despite uBlock Origin Lite being more limited than uBlock Origin, there were people who preferred the Lite approach of uBlock Origin Lite, which was designed from the ground up to be an efficient suspendable extension, thus a good match for Firefox on Android.  From this point on, there will no longer be a package published in the release section for Firefox, except for the latest one, uBlock Origin Lite 2024.9.22.986, if and when it's approved."



So then Raymond apparently received some additional non-sympathetic feedback...



LEO:  Oh, boy.  Don't poke the bear.



STEVE:  Uh-huh, about his decision to completely drop uBlock Origin Lite from Firefox since he final posted on October 1st, last Tuesday, was:  "Looks like the sentence 'however trivial this may look to an outsider, it's a burden I don't want to take on' is lost on many who want to have an opinion about all of this.  I dropped support for uMatrix years ago because it had become a burden I could not take on.  This is such a case here, where the unwarranted de-listing of uBlock Origin Lite and the requirement of having to deal with this caused the support to maintain a Firefox version to cross the line into the 'burden I cannot take on' territory.  Amount of burden to take on is a personal decision, not something to be decided by others."



And just to add a bit of objectivity, since Gorhill has clearly taken a stand on this, here's a sympathetic comment I found six days ago over on Ycombinator, where somebody completely different said:  "I manage a medium-size browser extension at work.  We also offered it on Firefox.  But I have spent the past year struggling to get back into Mozilla store after a manual review.  As far as I can tell, there are maybe two reviewers that are based in Europe (Romania?).  The turnaround time is long when I am in the U.S., and it has been rife with this same kind of 'simple mistake' that takes two weeks to resolve."



He says:  "You need a privacy policy."  We already have one.  "You are using machine-generated code and minified code."  No, you are looking at the built code, not the included source.  "We cannot reproduce your source."  Right.  That's because you didn't follow the instructions and are in the wrong directory.



LEO:  Oh, boy.



STEVE:  He says:  "Very frustrating."  And there were a number of other similar comments.  So it appears that Mozilla really does currently have a problem with this aspect of their bureaucracy; and that Gorhill, someone who has, shall we say, an extremely low threshold of tolerance for any sort of incompetence that's impeding him, finally just decided that it wasn't worth his time or energy to fight a frustrating battle.



LEO:  He doesn't take fools lightly.  And god bless him.



STEVE:  No, exactly.



LEO:  You know what, I don't blame him.  And god, I'm so grateful that he writes this and gives it away for free.  It must be a significant amount of work.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  And I don't blame him for saying it's just not worth additional effort.



STEVE:  No.  So we have the full story.  Under Chrome we get an extra six months of the use of full uBlock Origin with the addition of that little policy tweak in Windows, and something equivalent is available on Mac and Linux.  Again, grc.sc/v2 will deliver the .REG file to a Windows user.  Double-click on it, say yes a couple times, and you're all set up.



I'll finish today's discussion with something you mentioned, Leo, at the top, which is, you know, we've got an evolving technology in our browser add-on ecosystem.  We have not talked about this large and significant question of the ethics surrounding editing received web pages to remove content, any content, that the website wishes to deliver and push on its visitors.



LEO:  That's a very good point.  That's a very good point.



STEVE:  Tracking scripts are one thing, but the more controversial removal is that which produces revenue for the site.  We know that today there are many websites that wholly depend upon the revenue from advertising to survive.  And we need look no further than this podcast's own hosting network TWiT to see firsthand the effects of advertising revenue becoming less available than it once was.



LEO:  Right, right.



STEVE:  So I will finish today's discussion by quoting the author of uBlock Origin.  Raymond Hill, Gorhill, says the following on his GitHub page for his original full-spectrum content blocker, uBlock Origin.  He writes:  "uBlock Origin is a CPU and memory-efficient wide-spectrum content blocker for Chromium and Firefox.  It blocks ads, trackers, coin miners, pop-ups, annoying anti-blockers, malware sites, et cetera, by default using EasyList, EasyPrivacy, Peter Lowe's Blocklist, Online Malicious URL Blocklist, and uBO filter lists.  There are many other lists available to block even more. Hosts files are also supported.  uBlock Origin uses the EasyList filter syntax and extends the syntax to work with custom rules and filters.  You may easily unselect any preselected filter lists if you think uBlock Origin blocks too much.  For reference, Adblock Plus installs with only EasyList, Adblock Plus filters, and Acceptable Ads enabled by default.



"It is important to note that using a blocker is NOT" - he has in all caps - "theft.  Do not fall for this creepy idea.  The ultimate logical consequence of blocking = theft is the criminalization of the inalienable right to privacy.  Ads, 'unintrusive' or not, are just the visible portion of the privacy-invading means entering your browser when you visit most sites.  uBlock Origin's primary goal is to help users neutralize these privacy-invading methods in a way that welcomes those users who do not wish to use more technical means."



So we've spent a lot of time through the 19-plus years of this podcast, as this industry has evolved, looking at this issue.  If advertisements were visually static and non-intrusive, if they were not planting cookies in my browser and running code in an active attempt to fingerprint me for the purpose of tracking my movements and compiling a list of everywhere I go and everything I do, and if the websites hosting these obnoxious privacy invasions were not actively complicit in this, then I would feel far more sympathetic to the need for websites to generate revenue by forcibly exposing me to things I do not want.



LEO:  And we should point out that there are many websites, Jason Snell's website is a good example, that have first-party ads that are plaintext, that are not blocked by uBlock Origin or any other adblocker.



STEVE:  Yup.



LEO:  They can't because they're first party.  It's part of the content.



STEVE:  Right.



LEO:  And so it is possible to have advertising that goes right through any adblocker because it's not invasive.  It doesn't invade your privacy.



STEVE:  Right.  And, you know, I do not believe that where we are today in the year 2024 is where we'll be 10 years from now.  If nothing else, we can see how the industry and government are struggling to come to an agreement and compromise.  I was disappointed that European regulators forced Google to abandon its significantly privacy-enforcing Privacy Sandbox technology. The fact that they were forced to give it up because it would have been so privacy-enforcing tells you all you need to know about the state of today's web technology.



LEO:  We talked about that on MacBreak weekly today, that you can't assume governments are going to always act in your favor and in favor of protecting your privacy.  In fact, they may be acting in favor of advertisers' right to invade your privacy, as in this case.  Yeah.



STEVE:  Yes.  And we know content control add-ons do not completely prevent tracking and profiling, but they do mitigate it.  And they do make the use of the web significantly more pleasant.  One thing seems clear:  If individual end users - the consumers of the ads and the targets of this tracking - do not push back within their means against this abuse of our attention and privacy, it's likely to take much longer for it to change.  So we're voting by saying no thank you, you know, fix your technology, and we won't have a problem.



LEO:  Cory Doctorow has called the widespread use of adblockers the largest consumer boycott in history.  Almost 50% of people who use the Internet now use adblocking technology.  And that's a pretty strong vote against.  Now, some people don't like ads, period.  I mean, there are really people who will just say, I'm not going to listen to an ad.  I'm not going to look at an ad.  I will block every ad.  I don't care what your monetization strategy is.  And so I think there is a percentage of people who just don't like ads.



STEVE:  Well, and websites have the option of sensing that somebody is refusing to look at ads and then refusing to show them content.



LEO:  Yeah, that's true.  Don't adblockers trying to get around that stuff?  No?



STEVE:  Yeah.  Again, you know, the controversial thing is that we're editing what our browser is doing.



LEO:  Yeah, right.



STEVE:  And you argue, hey, why do I not have the right to do that?



LEO: Yeah, I mean, it is... 



STEVE:  To decide what I want my browser to do on my computer.



LEO:  Yeah.  It's your screen, your computer.



STEVE:  Yup.



LEO:  This is a tough, this is a really difficult one.  And I do have to point out that a lot of websites have gone out of business this year, including AnandTech, iMore, because there was no way to get around this consumer boycott.  There's no way to make a living.  We're faced with that, as well.  I understand people don't like ads.  I don't know what the answer is to this.  Our ads are not - they may be intrusive.  I don't think they're non-intrusive, but they do not spy on you, and they're not malware in any form.  They're just audio.  A lot of people fast-forward through them.  There's no real way to block them, but they might fast-forward through them.  I don't know what the answer is, Steve.  I really don't.  This is a tough one because we want journalism; right?



STEVE:  And part of the problem is, I mean, ads really are obnoxious.  They have discovered that if you turn the volume up, then your dollar amount goes up.  So the moment you see that, everyone's going to turn the volume up.  And then they're competing with each other to see who has the most volume.



LEO:  It's a vicious circle.



STEVE:  And a lot of them are really obnoxious.



LEO:  I agree.



STEVE:  I can't watch television without being able to fast-forward past the ads.



LEO:  But Steve, do you want everything to have a paywall?  Because that's the option.



STEVE:  That's a problem, too.



LEO:  I mean, that's really the option is that you can't read it unless you pay for it.



STEVE:  So I would have no problem paying for something that I use routinely.  That is, you know, for example, the Washington Post, The New York Times, some site.  But I'm not a person who is consuming a great deal of focused online content.  I'm not reading The New York Times or the Washington Post or any online content in a go back and, like, to it constantly.  I'm annoyed that my iPhone keeps offering me news that I can't read because when I click on it I have to be Apple Plus or Apple News Plus.  It's like, don't show this to me if I can't read it.



LEO:  So there's the large issue.  You live in a small town.  I live in a small town.  The New York Times and the Washington Post are not going to cover our city council meetings or school board meetings, the initiatives we're voting on in a couple of weeks because it's not national news.  And yet we don't have local newspapers anymore because there's no money, there's no support, no financial support.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  So that means we've got an electorate that is fundamentally, unless they really go out and look, ill-informed on the issues of the day.  That's a problem, too.  So this is a very thorny issue.  I am very - I do want to be clear, though.  I am grateful to Raymond Hill for uBlock Origin.  I use it on every darn computer.  I'm not happy that Google is making it useless on Chrome.  I hope that Firefox continues to support it.  And I understand that there is definitely a contradiction in my use of an adblocker and my making my living through an ad-supported network.  I don't know what the answer is.

ARCHIVE:	https://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm



DESCRIPTION:  A great deal more about uBlock Origin which we've been underutilizing.  National Public Data files for bankruptcy (is anyone surprised?).  Will the .IO top-level Internet domain be disappearing?  Last week was Patch Tuesday; what did we learn?  Firefox fixed a bad remote exploit that was attacking Tor users.  Why a Server edition of Windows won't substitute for a desktop edition.  A look back at a fabulous multiplatform puzzle/game from 2015.  Feedback on Saturday's surprise Security Now! Mailing.  More on "What's the best router?"  What in the world is BIMI for email?  What it does and what it promises.  And next week we dig into the just-announced Passkey "Credential Exchange Protocol" which promises to deliver passkey portability.



SHOW TEASE:  It's time for Security Now!.  Steve Gibson is here.  He realizes, as we all have, that uBlock Origin is the greatest extension ever for your browser - he's come up with some really interesting additional uses for it - debunks the widespread story heard here and everywhere else about the .io top-level domain disappearing; and gets into this whole new thing called BIMI, a new email authentication standard.  He even walks us through signing up.  It's all coming up next on Security Now!.



LEO LAPORTE:  This is Security Now! with Steve Gibson, Episode 996, recorded Tuesday, October 15th, 2024:  BIMI (Up Scotty).



It's time for Security Now!, the show where we cover your security, your privacy, your safety, the Internet, science fiction, and anything Steve wants to talk about - Vitamin D - with this guy right here, Steve Gibson of GRC.com.  Hi, Steve.



STEVE GIBSON:  Leo, it's great to be with you.  Middle of October.  Exactly...



LEO:  Is there a chill in the air in beautiful Irvine?



STEVE:  ...three weeks from now there may be a chill in the air.



LEO:  Oh, geez.  Don't bring that up.  Oy.  You know how much anxiety I have over November 5th?  I can feel it, the pit of my stomach.



STEVE:  Yeah, it's going to be really fun.



LEO:  We will either be cheerful on Wednesday or not.



STEVE:  I'm a spectator.  I have no control.  We're both in California, so nothing will be really...



LEO:  Yeah, we don't really get a choice.



STEVE:  And that's really - isn't that annoying?



LEO:  Yes.



STEVE:  That, like, yeah, they're just focusing on three or four states, and those are the ones who - on the other hand, I don't miss all the ads that those poor people in those states are getting buried by.



LEO:  I don't know about you, but I am buried by text messages, five or six a day now.  Do you not get a lot of campaign...



STEVE:  Lorrie made the mistake of giving money once.  And OMG.



LEO:  Oh, that's why.  Yeah, I donated money.  So that's why I'm on the list.



STEVE:  They never forget you.  They come back and say, well, if we got five bucks, there's got to be another five available.



LEO:  And it's always an emergency.



STEVE:  Oh, yeah.  Oh.



LEO:  It's always panicking.



STEVE:  It's end of the world.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  You know, do you have your snorkel, to fill your bathtub with water and... 



LEO:  It's kind of amazing.



STEVE:  ...drown yourself.



LEO:  Oh, my god.  It has literally made my text messaging unusable for the past month.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  And I just...



STEVE:  Think about how the mailman feels, too.  Suddenly, like, they had to increase the size of the trucks in order to get all of those ridiculous "he's bad, he's good, he's bad, he's good, she's bad, she's good."  Oh, it's like, oh, really?



LEO:  It's actually a windfall for both the postal service and your local news and TV and radio stations because all the political spending, you know, goes right into them.  And the postal service, if it weren't for junk mail, would not exist.



STEVE:  No.  And I send, you know, every month I collect my receipts and send them to Sue.  It used to be 15 cents.  Now it's $2.43.



LEO:  Not cheap, yeah.



STEVE:  So, you know, yikes.



LEO:  Well, I've got my ballot, and I'm ready to vote.



STEVE:  I remember when a candy bar...



LEO:  Yup.  I presume you got - everybody in California gets a mail-in ballot, which is tremendously convenient.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  And so I've got mine.  If you are watching, and you are not yet registered, or you're not sure, check, make sure you're registered, and then get out and vote, either by mail now or in person on...



STEVE:  The good news is that in California the ballots come with the "I Voted" sticker in them.



LEO:  Yes.  You can put it on right now.



STEVE:  So I will have mine right on my forehead in three weeks.



LEO:  Yeah, yeah.  If you go to Vote.org, I believe, I think that's the URL, you can check your registration.  They have a little registration checker.  You have 20 days in most states to - 20 days till election day.  In many states you only have a few more days to register.  All right.  This has been the political announcement.  Let's move on to the reason people are here, security.  What's up this week?



STEVE:  So a great deal more this week about uBlock Origin, which it turns out we've pretty much all, actually there are some exceptions within our listener base, but we've pretty much been underutilizing what it can do.



LEO:  I liked your emergency email midweek.  I did that immediately.



STEVE:  Yes, yes.  Everybody who has subscribed to the Security Now! email listing received an unplanned - I didn't even plan it.  But Saturday morning, when I made this thing work, I thought, oh, I have to share this news.  And, you know, since it's easy for me to do now, 10,442 people received a surprise email...



LEO:  That's kind of amazing.



STEVE:  ...because of their Security Now! subscription, explaining how to easily turn off those increasingly prevalent and thus annoying when they're unwanted, which they typically are, Login With Google pop-ups.  And I think it was because I went to Stack Exchange, I was doing some coding, and I thought - and I did a Google search, I clicked a link to Stack Exchange, up it came.  And I looked at it, and I realized, you know, I've been getting so many of these, and they are so annoying.  And then I thought, wait a minute.  We have uBlock Origin.  I wonder if it could help?



Anyway, we're going to start by talking about that.  Also the question of will the .io top-level Internet domain be disappearing?  There's some talk that it should, but I don't think it should.  Also last week was Patch Tuesday.  What did we learn from that?  Firefox had a bad remote code exploit that was being used to attack Tor users on their Firefox-based Tor browser.  I realized why the Server edition of Windows does not substitute for a desktop.  We talked about this a couple weeks ago, and I've been meaning to bring it back up.  Today's the day.



Also we're going to look back, thanks to a question or an observation or actually a discovery from one of our listeners at a fabulous multiplatform puzzle game that we got all hot and bothered over back in 2015.  Also I do have some couple pieces of feedback from that surprise mailing on Saturday.  We've got a little bit more on what's the best router.  And then I titled today's podcast "BIMI (Up Scotty)," B-I-M-I.  Actually, it's apparently supposed to be pronounced "bemmy."  But I like BIMI.



LEO:  It's BIMI.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  What do you mean, "bemmy"?		



STEVE:  Yeah, BIMI, I mean, that - you have B-I-M-I.



LEO:  You don't wear a "bekini," you wear a bikini.  What are you talking about?



STEVE:  We're going to answer the question, what in the world is BIMI for email.



LEO:  Okay. 



STEVE:  What it does, what it promises, and if it's going to actually happen.  It's trying to.  And then I just - I will end by noting that we're going - next week, because it just happened yesterday, and I didn't have a chance to get up to speed.  We have the FIDO Group has just announced the credential exchange protocol, CXP, for passkeys.  Which, when implemented, will give us the one thing we've really been needing, which is a means of backing up and transporting passkeys between providers.  So, oh, and I didn't get it into the show notes also, I'll talk about it next week, but all of our listeners started sending me the news that RSA crypto had been broken by Chinese researchers...



LEO:  I saw that, yeah.



STEVE:  ...who figured out how to use the D-Wave quantum computer.



LEO:  Quantum, yeah.



STEVE:  And it's like, oh, my god.  It's like, well, Leo, what was it?  We left off at, was it 13 bits that they could factor?



LEO:  Yeah, yeah.



STEVE:  The breakthrough is 22.



LEO:  Oh.



STEVE:  Now, we are running at 2048, so... 



LEO:  Oh.  So you're saying they broke a weak RSA password.



STEVE:  No.  They didn't even break R.  They didn't break the leading bit of font of the R.  I mean, 22 bits?  And you can't decompose factorization, otherwise we would have a long time ago.



LEO:  Right, right, right.  



STEVE:  So the fact that they got - they cracked, ooh, they factored a 22-bit number.  Good going.  Keep at it.



LEO:  Yeah, keep up the good work.  We'll see you in a few decades.



STEVE:  And meanwhile, RSA is alive and well, I mean, actual RSA.  It never had a weaker key than 1024.  I don't think there was a 512 bit.  Maybe in the early, you know...



LEO:  For a while I remember the U.S. government wanted us to use very small passcodes.  I can't remember if it was 128 or 42, I think it was.



STEVE:  Those were the symmetric keys where it was...



LEO:  It was a small...



STEVE:  It was disturbingly small.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  Yeah, back in the early, well, it wasn't TLS, it was SSL back then.



LEO:  Right, yeah.



STEVE:  And the idea was, if you didn't export it, you could have a useful strength.  But if you, oh, you couldn't leave the country.  Well, websites left the country.  So it was necessary for them to all be neutered.  But, you know, it's not like we were doing anything important back then.  They were all using HTTP.  So, like, not a big deal.  So anyway, we have a Picture of the Week after our first announcement break.  And we'll share that and get into a bunch of fun podcast stuff.



LEO:  Exciting.  Steve, I have the Picture of the Week queued up and ready.  Shall we look at it together?



STEVE:  So I gave this one the caption, "When your message interferes with your message."



LEO:  Hmm.  All right, I get it right away.  Because I like to ride my bike around town.



STEVE:  So for those who don't have the show notes in front of them...



LEO:  Geez, Louise.



STEVE:  ...or are not watching the video, we have one of those large sort of mobile road signs which is lit up.  They often have like a bunch of batteries on them.  Sometimes they have a little generator, you know, keeping them alive.  Anyway, this sign brightly says on three lines, "Give Cyclists Space."



LEO:  Oh, my god.



STEVE:  Unfortunately, it is right smack dab in the middle of and completely blocking the cyclist lane.  Which it's telling everyone you need to give more space to.



LEO:  Give them space, please.  Yeah.



STEVE:  So that's right.  



LEO:  That's pretty typical of our civic fathers, yes.



STEVE:  Yes.  There're no broken bicycles and maimed bodies laying around there.  But anyway, yes.  When your message interferes with your message.



LEO:  No kidding.



STEVE:  Okay.  So everyone is annoyed - we know this because we've talked about it often - by the pervasive cookie permission banners which compliance with the European Union's GDPR has forced upon the world.  I recently realized that I had become similarly annoyed by another increasingly pervasive website feature, which is the proactive offer to sign into whatever website I may be briefly visiting.



LEO:  Here's the example that you gave on Stack Overflow.



STEVE:  Yup.



LEO:  And there it is up in the upper right-hand corner for Stack Exchange.  Sign into Stack Exchange with Google.  I don't want to.



STEVE:  Right.  And so, okay.  So I'll just address this to the listeners of this podcast who for whatever reason have not yet subscribed to the weekly Security Now! mailing.  You may think, oh, well, fine, you know, I'm going to hear it anyway.  Well, when I realized I had a solution to this Saturday morning, I thought, oh, let's tell everybody.  So...



LEO:  So help me do this on this machine because I haven't done it on this machine yet.



STEVE:  Okay.



LEO:  There I am in the upper right-hand corner.  I've gone into the uBlock Origin settings, and I'm going to click the gears.



STEVE:  Actually, what we should probably do is wait until I update you and everyone with the better solution.



LEO:  Oh.  Oh, you've got a better one.



STEVE:  I've got a better one.



LEO:  Okay.  Because I did the manually entering in the filter thing.



STEVE:  Yes.  And that works for most people.  There were some people for whom it didn't work.  Okay.  So I'm getting ahead of myself.  So, okay.  So just to be clear, I don't want to have people misunderstand my annoyance here.  I often choose to sign into websites using my Google account identity because Google provides a very secure implementation of OAuth.  My primary email, you know, everyone knows, my main email is going to be a GRC mailbox, so my Google email is my generic catchall throwaway account that most of us have one or two or more of these days.  So signing in with Google gives me convenient one-click login at any site that offers it.



And, yes, we know, being OAuth means that Google knows where I am, where I'm signing in, and what I'm doing.  But Google almost certainly knows that anyway, and the truth is, you know, I don't really have time to care.  You know, all other things being equal, yeah, I would choose privacy.  Who wouldn't?  And I get it that there are people, many of them are our listeners, who make a hobby out of the rigorous enforcement of their online privacy.  I respect that, but that's not me.  I'm in a hurry.  And since I have no way of gauging my actual success at privacy enforcement due to the myriad sneaky ways in which it can and is being violated, it's not something I'm willing to invest in heavily.



So, okay.  For the sake of convenience, I use Login With Google when I'm at some site where I do want to log in for some purpose.  And that's not a problem.  I like having the option to sign in with Google.  And at that point it's not the source of my annoyance.  The source of my annoyance is that what we are seeing, and I can now speak for our listeners because I heard, by mid-afternoon on Saturday I had 135 pieces of email from our listeners saying, "Oh, my god, thank you, thank you, thank you."  Some said it was life-changing.  I mean, clearly I was not alone in this really bugging me.



So the source of the annoyance is that this trend has been developing to proactively PUSH signing in with Google on us wherever we go and whenever we visit a participating website, even if we have absolutely zero interest in or need to sign in there.  You know, I don't want to sign into every website on the Internet, and I believe that's the case for most of us.  You know, if I want to sign into a website, I'll click the site's Sign-In or Login link and be taken to a page to do that; thank you very much.  I don't need to have "signing in" suggested to me or pushed on me.  And what happened Saturday morning was it finally - it was like the straw that I finally realized, okay, I'm really being annoyed by these.



Okay.  So I'm skipping over a little bit in my notes here that I've already covered.  So this occurred to me thanks to last week's discussion of uBlock Origin.  My original solution, the one that I came up with Saturday morning and shared, was very specific, and it has the advantage of only doing exactly that one thing.  However, it did not work for everyone.  Some people needed a somewhat broader solution, which turns out is easy.  And it also turned out that this sort of annoyance blocking is also built into some of uBlock Origin's already existing filter lists.



LEO:  That's what I was wondering, if there's a checkbox.



STEVE:  Yes, there is, and we're going to be there in a minute.  So they're not turned on by default.  Well, for our listeners probably.  They are for me, and I'm happier even than I was Saturday afternoon.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  Okay.  So the way we got into this is, as you were going to do, Leo, if you open the uBlock Origin dropdown, and then click on the little gears, you get taken to a series of web pages that have tabs across the top.  The My Filters tab is initially empty.  Mine was empty.  I didn't have any, you know, custom filters there.  And then the instructions that I gave were to first put in a comment line so that when you come back to this in a year...



LEO:  You know what you did.



STEVE:  You're not going to be, what?  What the heck is that?  You know, anyone who's done any coding, by the time you're our age, Leo, we've become humbled.  We've realized that...



LEO:  We forget.



STEVE:  ...no matter how sure we are that we will never forget this wonderful code that we've just created, a week could go by, and we look at it and go, what the heck is that?  You know, who wrote that?  You're looking around for anybody else.  It's like, did I do that?  Anyway, so any line that begins with an exclamation point is a comment.  So I said, "! Block 'Sign in with Google' iframe in top right corner of websites."  And then the filter phrase to do that is two vertical bars, which is sort of - it sort of stands in for the normal //.  Anyway, the vertical bars tell the easy filter list syntax, which is what Gorhill has adopted, that what follows is a domain name.  So "||accounts.google.com/gsi/iframe."



Okay.  So that says when the browser attempts to load something from a URL that begins with this, just skip over it.  Just say, eh, these are not the droids you're interested in.  So nothing happens.  Now, it turns out that a couple people wrote back and said, well, that did not work.  But if I put "client" instead of "iframe," then it worked.  Or even broader, if you do an asterisk.  Asterisk is sort of the generally accepted wildcard character.  So if you did //gsi/*, then that generally works for more cases.  Now, you might think, oh, wait a minute, maybe a wildcard is more than I want.  Well, okay.  You could put one line with "iframe," and then another line below it with "client," and block those two.  But gsi, you know, so we're accounts.google.com/gsi, that certainly stands for Google Sign-In.  So it seems like safe...



LEO:  That's fair to block that.



STEVE:  ...to follow that with an asterisk and just know that you're going to nuke anything that tries to put up on your screen to do that.  Okay.  But after the email went out, I started getting some feedback from people.  One of them said, well, I'm not getting those, and I think I know why.  So rather than the "My Filters" tab, we click the preceding tab, which is "Filter Lists."  Down near the bottom you'll find a group of three filter lists under the heading "Annoyances."  Couldn't have phrased it better myself.  Open up the list of three and you'll see "EasyList," "AdGuard," and "uBlock." 



Now, it's so easy to get one of those annoying Google Sign-In pop-ups - just go over to Reddit.com, for example, that it was easy to experiment with enabling and disabling these three lists.  I discovered that enabling either of the first two, EasyList or AdGuard, would suppress - yes, and look at how comprehensive that is, Leo.



LEO:  This is the "uBlock" one,  yeah.



STEVE:  Oh, okay.  And EasyList and AdGuard are similar.  Either of those two suppresses that gratuitous Google Sign-In popup.  In other words, people have been here before us.



LEO:  Oh, yeah.



STEVE:  And they've already fixed this for us.  We just didn't tell them, "fix this."



LEO:  I think one of these also blocks the cookie banner, if I remember.



STEVE:  Ah, that's the one.  Actually, yes.  Okay.  So we have some documentation for the AdGuard list.  And so under AdGuard's list, under the Annoyances filter, they said:  "Annoyances filter blocks irritating elements on web pages, including the following AdGuard filters.  All of them can be enabled separately from the Annoyances filter."  In this case, Cookie Notices blocks cookie notices on web pages.  Popups blocks all kinds of pop-ups that are not necessary for websites' operation.  Mobile App Banners blocks banners that promote mobile apps of websites.  You know, thank you anyway.  Widgets blocks third-party widgets: online assistants, live support chats, all that nonsense.  Other Annoyances blocks elements that do not fall under the popular categories of annoyances.  At that point I thought, okay, I am all in.



LEO:  Turn them all on.



STEVE:  Yes.  And mine are.



LEO:  In fact, I'm going to turn on all the uBlock Filters.  But I have to point out, occasionally you'll be on a website where they do things in a pop-up that this could break.  So you have to be aware you've done that.



STEVE:  Yes.



LEO:  And whenever I have trouble on sites I just disable uBlock on that site.



STEVE:  Turn it off briefly, and then it'll work.  Yes, that is exactly the correct strategy.



LEO:  And don't forget to click "Apply Changes" when you do this.



STEVE:  Correct.  So actually you want the "Update Now," which does both.



LEO:  Oh, okay.



STEVE:  So, okay.  So I also did want to mention the other thing that I'm sure people are seeing and being annoyed by are those "Would you like some help" sliding up from the upper right.



LEO:  Hate that guy.  I hate that guy.



STEVE:  No, I don't want any help.  I want you to stop distracting me and leave me alone.  So that's gone now, too.  And while we're here, I'll just mention that the section above Annoyances is Social Widgets.  So we have the EasyList, the AdGuard, and the Fanboy social widgets.  And it's described as "Social media filter removes numerous 'Like' and 'Tweet' buttons and other social media integrations on popular websites."  That may not be something everybody wants, but I bet you that there are a lot of people...



LEO:  Anybody who listens to this show wants it.



STEVE:  Exactly.



LEO:  The thing is, this is why we're really sad about Google disabling what is easily the most important tool on the web, I think.



STEVE:  Yes, yes.  So those are turned on on mine.  And as I said, after you've done that, you'll want to click the Update button, which will refresh, download the latest instance of those lists, and then bring them current.  And life has been sweet ever since this happened.  It's like, oh, whew.



LEO:  Whew.



STEVE:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.



LEO:  What a relief.  No longer do I see on Reddit the pop-up saying, "You want to use Google?  Yeah, come on, I know you do."  That's nice.



STEVE:  I know.  I know.  So anyway, so I wanted to thank everybody who did take the time to say, hey, Steve, take a look over here, because that allowed me to get this into today's podcast and update everyone with what I think is a superior solution.  And, you know the cool thing about this is that these lists are being constantly curated by people who do really enjoy this.  They're chasing these things down.  Some of the expressions on these things, I mean, they're also professional filter list builders because these things are hair-curling.  But so they're going in with a scalpel and saying, okay, exactly THAT I don't want.  And we don't want to break anything else.  Just stop doing THAT to me.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  And so this does that.  Now, the other thing that is different about this from the uBlock Origin Lite is that - and Gorhill mentioned this, and we talked about it last week.  The V2 Manifest is able to independently update its lists.  That's not something that Chrome wants to promote going forward.  It's not available in Manifest V3.  So you'll need like a new version of the entire add-on extension, rather than the extension being able to reach out and update the lists on its own behalf.  So that's another, as you said, Leo, it's why we're annoyed with Google.



Now, I'm sure, since Chrome has 37 million users of uBlock Origin, compared to Firefox's seven, that Gorhill will be incentivized to do everything he can to make the Lite version as powerful as possible.  And as we know from last week, we do have nine months more until Chrome users lose access to the V2 Manifest, thanks to the policy tweak that we found and shared last week.  So a lot can happen in nine months.  You know, we've seen Chrome back off on terminating third-party cookies when it turns out they couldn't.  So maybe there will be sufficient pressure on them to reconsider saying no to V2.  Or maybe they'll just turn it off for most people, but they'll give us a little backdoor where, if we really must have it, we'll be able to, like, maybe have a policy that says I'll make a registry tweak if I can keep my V2 Manifest.



LEO:  They're going to do something about it because, as you point out, Brave, and many of the people in our chatroom, has all these lists built in.



STEVE:  Yes.



LEO:  By the way, you know, I use Arc from The Browser Company, which I love.  It's also a Chromium-based browser.  And what Arc has, what The Browser Company has already said is, yeah, if once V3 is in our browser, because it's going to be, as it will be in any Chromium browser, we're going to have to write our own blocker and put it in the browser that way, as Brave has done.  So that's - I think Chrome's at great risk of losing a huge number of people by forcing this.  So we'll see what happens.  You're right, it may not happen.  I wouldn't be surprised.



STEVE:  So I'll just say that, after enabling the six additional filter lists for uBlock Origin, I'm more happy than I've ever been that I'm using Firefox, which shows no sign of getting rid of V2 compatibility and uBlock Origin.  And we have a bit of feedback that I'll share down in our feedback section.  But this has sort of brought me to the awareness that we've been underutilizing this marvelous tool.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  Because, you know, I could have had these turned on a long time ago and saved myself a lot of clicks of, you know - the other thing, Leo, this thing, this unsolicited sign-in prompt for a site I don't want to sign into covers up regions of the screen that, like, I have to see sometimes.  So it's like it's annoying.  You can't move it.  You have to close it.



LEO:  I find it most annoying like on Reddit, where I already have a login.  I don't want to use the Google login because I already have a login.  And it covers up the part of the screen where you click to log in.  It's incredibly frustrating.  It's terrible.  Terrible design.



STEVE:  Okay.  So anyway, I want to just...



LEO:  Good on your mailing list, though.  I'm glad that you sent that out as a burst.  And nobody complained about that; right?



STEVE:  I did not get a single complaint.  In fact, I said at the end, I said, I hope you don't mind me interfering, you know, interrupting your weekend for this.  I was a little - I did feel a bit self-conscious because it was, you know, it was unscheduled.  And, you know, Security Now! list subscribers did explicitly sign up to that list to receive weekly podcast summaries, the show notes and the Pictures of the Week.  Everyone said they loved it; okay?



And since the system that I built makes it so effortless to send these sorts of announcement mails to what we now - I think we're now at 10,500-plus subscribers - I would like to formally expand the mission of that list, I am announcing it here, to include things like this in the future.  I don't know what they might be, but I'll make sure that whatever it is will be, you know, have a high probability of being of interest to everyone, just like this one certainly appeared to be.  So thank you for our subscribers, and I'm glad that I was able to brighten everyone's weekend because it certainly did that.



LEO:  Yeah.  You're right, we underutilize one of the greatest things in the world.  And now that we're about to lose it...



STEVE:  Yeah, now we're appreciating it.



LEO:  We're appreciating it.



STEVE:  Wait, wait, I'm sorry, honey, I didn't mean it.



LEO:  Come back.



STEVE:  So under the heading "It couldn't happen to a nicer guy," last Wednesday The Register reported that everyone's favorite massive data leaker, National Public Data...



LEO:  Boo, hiss.



STEVE:  ...a.k.a. NPD, the organization which first collected the personal data on pretty much everyone, then had their collected data stolen, sold first on the dark web and finally released publicly, has, not surprisingly, filed for bankruptcy.



The Register wrote:  "The Florida business behind the data brokerage National Public Data has filed for bankruptcy, admitting 'hundreds of millions' of people were potentially affected in one of the largest information leaks of the year."



Now, just to recap a bit:  "Last June," as we know, "the hacking group USDoD put a 277GB file of data online that contained information on about 2.9 billion individuals, and asked $3.5 million for it.  The data came from National Public Data," they wrote, "a brokerage owned by Jerico Pictures, which offered background checks to corporate clients via its API.



"NPD confirmed it had been hacked in an attack on December 2023 and initially said just 1.3 million people had lost personal details," you know, "such as name, email address, phone number, social security number, and mailing addresses.  But in the court documents filed for bankruptcy, the business concedes the total is much higher.



"The bankruptcy petition from Jerico Pictures states:  'The debtor is likely liable through the application of various state laws to notify and pay for credit monitoring for hundreds of millions of potentially impacted individuals.  As the debtor's schedules indicate, the enterprise cannot generate sufficient revenue to address the extensive potential liabilities, not to mention defend the lawsuits and support the investigations.  The debtor's insurance has declined coverage."  Oh, you bet they have.



"According to the filing, the organization is facing more than a dozen class-action lawsuits over the data loss and potential 'regulatory challenges' from the FTC and more than 20 U.S. states.  Any plaintiffs will have a hard time getting paid any money out of Jerico since the documents state the business has," shall we say, "very limited physical assets.



"In the accounting document, the sole owner and operator, Salvatore Verini, Jr., operated the business out of his home using two HP Pavilion desktop computers valued at $200 each, a ThinkPad laptop estimated to be worth $100, and five Dell servers worth an estimated $2,000.  It lists, the company lists $33,105 in its corporate checking account in New York as its assets, although the business pulled in $1,152,726 in its last fiscal year, and estimates its total assets are between $25,000 and $75,000 all told.  It also lists 27 Internet domains with a value of $25 each.  These include the corporate website, which is now defunct, as well as a host of other URLs including CriminalScreen.com, RecordsCheck.net, and asseeninporn.com."



So yes, we have another example of legislation running far behind the consequences of technology.  At some point it's going to become clear that the aggregation of large quantities of personal data, along with its merging into comprehensive profiles, itself, that is, just the aggregation and consolidation present an inherent danger.  But today there's no regulation over this.  Anyone who wishes to can amass such data to create essentially a latent data bomb.  On the one hand, it's free enterprise and capitalism, which no one wants to stifle.  But allowing fly-by-night operations of this sort to do this is clearly a problem.  The solution may be to require any such information aggregator to have a substantial bond posted, plus a verifiably effective insurance policy in place to cover the losses and lawsuits that would follow any egregious breach of responsibility.



This would nicely serve to "privatize" the risk so that the investors who would be required to create and post the bond, and the insurance company who would be collecting insurance premiums and would be on the hook for their losses, would both be motivated to assure that the enterprise's IT staff, its procedures, and security are adequate to protect their investment.  It's the only way I could see that this makes sense moving forward.



We're going to have to have some legislation which says anybody who does and, you know, aggregate data and, you know, the attorneys can figure out what exact language to use, but the idea being anyone who is warehousing quantities of data affecting over some number, some minimum number of individuals, must have the ability to pay for the consequences of the loss of that data.  Otherwise, sorry, you know, you can't collect it.  Maybe we'll get there someday.  It's just going to take legislation.



Okay.  Many of the top-level domains that we have today we have because they're associated with countries.  You know, the bit.ly service that I used to use, "bit.ly," you know, that "ly" is the country code for Libya.  That's why .ly existed and why it was possible for bit.ly to get the domain "bit" in Libya's country code, .ly.  And when I left there, of course, I created grc.sc.  Well, .sc is the country of Seychelles.  So I got GRC.sc because Seychelles has its own top-level domain, .sc.  And as we know, there are lots of top-level domains that are created independently, you know, .com, .org, .net, .edu, the original big four.  But when a top-level domain belongs to a country, it's tied to that country.



This has recently created some concern because a couple of weeks ago, on October 3rd, the British government announced that it would be releasing its claim of sovereignty over a small tropical atoll in the Indian Ocean, and that these islands would be handed over to the neighboring island country of Mauritius, which lies about 1,100 miles off the southeast coast of Africa.  Now, remember that I said the island nation being dissolved was in the Indian Ocean?  Well, that country's top-level domain is .io, as in Indian Ocean.  And the presumption is that, as has happened a few times in the past, when the country controlling its top-level domain is dissolved for any reason, so too is its top-level domain.  And given the strong interest in and use of the .io domain, that presents a problem.



What's supposed to happen is that once Britain signs the new treaty with Mauritius, the British Indian Ocean Territory will formally cease to exist, so various international bodies will update their records.  In particular, the International Standard for Organization (ISO) will remove country code "IO" from its specification list.  The IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, which creates and delegates the top-level domains, uses the ISO's specification to determine which top-level country domains should exist.  Once IO is removed, the IANA is supposed to refuse to allow any new registrations with a .io domain.  And it's supposed to automatically begin the process of retiring existing domains within the .io top level.



What's not known at this point is whether this will actually be allowed to happen.  You know, humans make the rules, and humans can change the rules that we've made.  And so, you know, if the rules are causing too much trouble, that may be what happens.  You know, we certainly have no lack of non-country TLDs.  You know, in addition to those original big four, there's for example .xyz, and .lol, and .online, which are not country domains.  So I, for one, see no reason why .io cannot similarly be repurposed, you know, just adopted as a valid non-country TLD.  People who are writing online are saying .io is going to go away.  But I find that hard to believe.  But again, I'm not the IANA, who ultimately decides these things.  So we'll see what happens.



I should note in passing that last Tuesday, October 8th, was the second Tuesday of the month, which meant that Microsoft and many others used the occasion to release their monthly patches.  Nothing was particularly notable this month.  Microsoft released updates to fix a total of 118 vulnerabilities across its software offerings, two of which were being actively exploited in the wild.  So of the 118 flaws, three were rated Critical, 113 are rated Important, and two were rated Moderate.  And, as is the case these days, that count does not include the 25 additional flaws that Microsoft previously updated in its Chromium-based Edge browser over the past month.  So, you know, good to update, as usual.  After the second Tuesday.  And restart your machines if you tend to leave them running all the time.



Also, Firefox, as I mentioned at the top, and the Firefox-based Tor Browser, have been warning everyone of the discovery of a serious attack which was levied against Tor users.  The flaw carries an attention-getting CVSS of 9.8, and it affects both Firefox and the Firefox Extended Support Release products.  It's a use-after-free bug that has been found in the Animation timeline component.  Mozilla reported in a post last Friday, October 11th, that it had received from ESET an exploit sample containing a "full exploit chain that allowed remote code execution on a user's computer," just by causing their browser to go to a web page.  So, yeah, that'll quality as a 9.8, you know, under anyone's scoring system.



Mozilla also noted that the fix was shipped within 25 hours of its responsible disclosure, so one day and one hour.  Two days previous to that, on Wednesday, Mozilla said:  "An attacker was able to achieve code execution in the content process by exploiting a use-after-free in Animation timelines," and then added:  "We have had reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild."  So the issue has been addressed in Firefox 131.0.2, ESR - that's the extended support release - ESR 128.3.1, and ESR 115.16.1.  The Tor project has also released an emergency update to what they're calling version 13.5.7 of their Tor Browser.  So certainly, if you are a Tor user, you'll want to make sure that your Tor Browser is updated to 13.5.7, since those were the targets of this attack.  But the vulnerability did affect everyone.



And as I mentioned at the top, next week - this just happened - we will be talking about the Credential Exchange Protocol.  So I have not had a chance, because I've been working on this podcast, to dig into it.  But I will have.  And unless something really very significant happens, I have a feeling that that will be the title of next week's podcast because that's something we're going to want to take a close look at and understand exactly what it is, what it does, and how it works.



LEO:  Yeah.  This is big news because this was something you could not do.



STEVE:  Yes.  Yes.



LEO:  And that's what's kept, frankly, kept people kind of frozen in place, I think, with passkeys, a little bit.



STEVE:  Many of - I took a quick look at it, Leo.  Many of the password manager people were participating in the development, as was Google.  I did not see Apple there.



LEO:  Not Apple.  See, this is a perfect example.  They don't have any incentive to let you move your passkeys off your iPhone because they want you to be stuck there forever.  Wow.



STEVE:  Yeah.  That was annoying.  It doesn't mean they're not going to adopt it.



LEO:  Right.  But they might have to if FIDO does.  I mean, don't they kind of want to keep full compatibility with a standard?  I would think so.



STEVE:  We'll see.



LEO:  Depends what FIDO Alliance says.  Is it required, or just optional?



STEVE:  Well, it will be optional, unfortunately.



LEO:  It has to be; right?



STEVE:  But then maybe at some point to get the next level of certification you'll need it, and then Apple will like, aghhhh.  I mean, it's really - it would be very short-sighted, I think.



LEO:  I agree.



STEVE:  For them to, I mean, almost punitive for them to say, no, if you use ours, you can't take them anywhere else.



LEO:  Right, right.



STEVE:  Okay.  Several weeks ago I mentioned that a listener of ours had suggested that when I move my Windows 7 workstation over to Windows 10, I choose a Windows Server version in order to have a simplified experience.  At the time, that sort of caught me by surprise, and I thought it was a great idea since Microsoft will presumably have exercised far greater restraint against including all of the unwanted Xbox, Candy Crush Jewels, Android phone integration, and all that other crap that they force on regular desktop Windows users.  But then I remembered that I had that idea a long time ago.  It may have been back in the Windows XP era that I did try running, and I did run for a while, a server edition of Windows as my desktop machine, probably because I wanted to be using exactly the same build of Windows that my servers were using back then.



But I hit a big problem.  The installers for many of the desktop applications I wanted to run would complain and refuse to proceed when they saw that I was running on a Server release of Windows.  I fought against that, and put up with it for a while.  I remember looking around, seeing if there was like some way I could create my own hack to make the Server edition look like the desktop version.  I didn't end up doing that.  I just ended up learning my lesson and deciding to go to a desktop.



And in fact, for example, the Windows 7 workstation version is essentially server, you know, Windows Server 2008 R2.  So it's essentially the same code anyway.  But I just wanted to close the loop on that in case anyone else was thinking, hey, that sounds like a great idea.  I'm going to run server.  I'll just caution you that in some cases apps just would not install.  In other cases, they said, well, if you're a server version, you're going to have to - it's going to cost you this much money, you know, like way more than it was for the equivalent desktop version.  So I just said no, thank you.



Okay.  Touching on sci-fi briefly, I am 15% into the book I said I would not read until its companion novel was also ready, though as I recall, my position on that was noticeably softening recently.  Anyway, yes, I now know a lot about Peter F. Hamilton's "Exodus:  The Archimedes Engine."  However, I don't know nearly as much as John Slanina, our JammerB, who is already well into his second read-through.  He noted that the second pass is more fun for him because by then you know who all the players are.  And, boy, the players are somewhat dizzying.  The book begins with a chronology which is stunning in its sweep and scope of humanity's near and far future.  And knowing Peter, I knew not to skip over that.  I figured this was important.  So I read all of that.



Then it runs through and introduces a vast array of characters.  And as I said, the historical summary was engaging, and I did force myself to sit still and at least take the time to read through all of the names of the entities whose roles were described mostly in relation to each other in that vast list.  And then the book began.  So I can well understand why John, upon finishing it once, would immediately reset his eBook to the beginning and go again.



So anyway, I don't know if I'll read it a second time immediately.  Maybe I'll wait for who knows how long for its second half of the whole story to be finished.  Anyway, I just did want to mention that, yeah, I'm in.  I was rereading the Frontiers Saga, like for the fourth time, and that was getting a little boring, actually.  So I thought, okay, let's try something new.  So I'm there.



Okay.  A bit of closing the loop with our listeners.  Brian Hendricks wrote.  He said:  "Hey, Steve.  I was looking for a new puzzle game to play on my tablet, and I saw that The Sequence Plus was released a couple of weeks ago.  I haven't tried it yet, but thoroughly enjoyed The Sequence at your recommendation a few years ago.  I tried The Sequence 2 when that came out, but I did not enjoy it as much."  He says:  "Hopefully this new game lives up to the original.  Happy Security Now!-ing to four digits and beyond."



Okay.  So I agree with Brian completely.  Whereas I loved The Sequence, I was disappointed by The Sequence 2, and I never bothered to spend much time with it once I saw that, in my opinion - and I guess his and others' - it missed the mark.  It turns out that it's not a simple matter to create a truly terrific puzzle game, which the original was.



So I agree that more of the original would be welcome, so I went looking for it.  It is nowhere that I was able to find it in Apple's notoriously horribly indexed App Store.  So I dropped back to searching the 'Net, and I found something called "The Sequence 2" in the Google Play store.  I have a link to it in the show notes for anyone who's interested.



I replied to Brian, asking whether he might be an Android person playing The Sequence 2 on an Android tablet, and he confirmed that he was.  So I'm hoping that it just hasn't yet surfaced in Apple's App store.  Since the author, who is an outfit by the name One Man Band, uses the Unity framework, it could also be available for iOS.  I'm hoping it's just delayed.  So anyway, I should note that also, when Brian said "a few years ago," he actually meant nine years ago, back in 2015.  So I wanted to tell all of our listeners there is a big treat awaiting any of our listeners who have joined us since then, who enjoy extremely well-crafted puzzle recreation and who are not yet familiar with what we've been talking about.



The Sequence, created as I said by One Man Band, is a sort of graphical sequential programming environment.  It's that perfect blend of progressively, increasingly difficult challenges where you're required to discover new tricks and problem-solving techniques as you progress forward through the game's levels.  You build machines composed of individual functional blocks, with each block having a single, very simple and very clear function.  And then you turn it loose to loop through its operation four or five times, since another requirement is that each iteration leaves the machine you've built in a stable state, ready to do it again.



And one final comment for those who may have heard of things like this before, only to be then disappointed.  I have, too.  We haven't talked about my affection for puzzles for years.  But I've often tried other things that sound exactly like what I just described, and I have been disappointed.  So I would never recommend them.  This one I recommend without reservation.  I have a link in the show notes to its author's website.  It's OMB, as in One Man Band, OMBGames.com.  And note that it's http only, not https.  So if your browser assumes "s," it'll complain one way or the other.  You want http://ombgames.com.  I also have a link to the author's official YouTube video in the show notes, and it earned this week's GRC Shortcut of the Week.



So you can get a quick sense for what I'm talking about by opening any browser and going to grc.sc/996, which is this week's episode number, grc.sc/996.  It is available for a few dollars without any ads or any in-app purchases, thank god, from the Windows Store, Steam, Apple's App Store, and Google Play.  If anyone discovers The Sequence Plus in Apple's App Store, please let me know.  I'll be all over that one.



And as I was preparing these show notes, I spent some time poking around the author's One Man Band site.  On his Contacts page he had both a Gmail and a Twitter handle.  So I first went over to Twitter, and I was surprised when Twitter said that he was following me.  The only way that was possible was that back in the day I had made such a fuss over The Sequence...



LEO:  Well, of course.  I'd be following you, too, my biggest fan.



STEVE:  Yeah.  You know.  So I figured that this podcast must have come to his attention, and he decided to follow me.  He had not posted anything recently over on his Twitter feed, so I shot him a note asking about the status of The Sequence Plus.  And not long after, I received a reply from him.  His first name is Maxim, and he wrote:  "Hi, Steve.  I'm glad to hear that everything is going well for you.  I'm grateful to you and your podcast for giving my little-known game a loving audience back in 2015.  As for The Sequence Plus, I can say that it is a slightly improved version of The Sequence, with some tweaks in the controls and fixes in certain levels.  It is free and contains ads, so it might not be suitable for everyone.  Let's just say this is my attempt to bring the game to a larger audience, as it is currently very difficult to promote paid games."



LEO:  Yeah.  Apple doesn't let you do demos or anything.  And that's a big problem, frankly.



STEVE:  Yeah, yeah.  He said:  "For now, it's only available on Google Play as an experiment."  He said: "I can't say for sure if I will release it on iOS, but for all lovers of logic puzzles on iOS, my three games are still available:  The Sequence, The Sequence 2, and Unit 404."  He said:  "Best regards, Maxim."



Okay.  So now we know.  And apparently he understands me, since I would gladly pay to not have any sort of advertisements in a good puzzle game.  I mean, we're only talking a couple of dollars for many hours of engaging mystery.  I've been driven nuts by the prevalence of advertising in iOS puzzles where, again, I would gladly pay for their removal and to have a quiet and puzzling experience.  I hate ads.



So it does not sound like The Sequence Plus would be anything I want, even if it were available for iOS.  You know, as Maxim said, it's largely just The Sequence as it used to be, but renamed and made free, but with ads.  So anyway, if you're someone who enjoys puzzles, my advice would be to follow GRC's shortcut of the week - as Leo, you did, and you played his little 50-second sample to give you a sense for what this is.  And if it looks appealing, lay down a couple of bucks on Maxim, either on iOS or Android, to purchase, or actually Windows or Steam, to purchase The Sequence, and get ready to have some fun.  I really think you will.



Parker Stacy wrote:  "Dear Steve.  Thank you for this EXTREMELY helpful tip."  He's referring to Saturday's email.  He said:  "You have saved me time.  You have saved me frustration.  You have saved me from the repetitive irritation felt on so many sites these days.  These annoyances on websites around the globe are more than just little gnats to be swatted away.  They divert our attention; and, more importantly, they divert our focus.



"When I'm researching something online, I'm usually trying to follow a train of thought  a thread, a path, a stack of ideas.  Something so seemingly mild as a cookie policy or sign-in-with-me box can interrupt my flow and completely unwind the stack, and it can take an unreasonable amount of time to rebuild it.  I know you know this, and I am grateful that you take the time to share these types of countermeasures with us.  This type of 'special' notification email is greatly welcomed, and I look forward to more in the future.  With gratitude and kind regards, Parker."



And I'll just note that his is a placeholder for the 135 replies I've received and read (so far) following Saturday's special mailing.  So I wanted to say thank you to everyone who took the time to mostly express their utter joy over the knowledge that it would be possible to suppress these unsolicited and unwanted login push pop-ups from appearing.  It turns out they're quite unpopular, and I was glad to learn that it wasn't just me being cranky that this was all about.  And as we know now, by turning on those pre-curated lists, we are getting rid of a whole host of other stuff.  But Leo, your point is very important.  If you go to a site where something seems broken, something doesn't work, it could be that uBlock Origin has been overprotective, in which case it's a matter just of opening it up and disabling it for the site, or briefly turning it off.  And then, you know, you'll get the full site in all of its glory, and you can wade through...



LEO:  And you may be sorry.



STEVE:  ...all the pop-ups and ads and nonsense, yes.  And finally, Frank from the Netherlands wrote:  "Dear Steve.  I wanted to report a feature of uBlock Origin that I don't see other people using, but that significantly improves my productivity.  In addition to blocking ads, I use uBlock Origin to clean up cluttered user interfaces.  Many web applications today include more features than I need, or aggressively promote new ones.  For example, ClickUp is now filled with AI buttons and banners.  I hide all these distractions to restore a clean interface that helps me focus on my work.  Hope it helps other listeners.  Best regards, Frank from the Netherlands."



So that's interesting.  There are still features of uBlock Origin that we're not using.  Frank is.  I just haven't spent any time with it.  And I'm beginning to feel like I'm missing a bet here.  uBlock Origin has like a dropper, and I think you're able to use it to go, like, click on something which allows you to identify the something on the page to it, and maybe you're able to say I don't want this anymore.  Anyway, I haven't looked.  But I wanted to share Frank's note to note that, again, most of us, certainly myself, have been grossly underutilizing the power of uBlock Origin.  It is an extremely capable general-purpose web experience filter.  



And, you know, I think the reason that it's been underutilized is probably a case of, you know, that old story about cooking the frog in the pot of water where you slowly increase the temperature so the frog never thinks to jump out, it just gets cooked.  For us, this incursion into our browsers has been very gradual and incremental.  You know, at first only a few sites were pushing that login popup for Google.  So we put up with a few of those unwanted appearances.  But over time, that number grew and grew until it was something some of us were seeing and tolerating throughout our day.  And those Google pop-ups were just one symptom.  What's happening is that little by little our online experiences have been increasingly leveraged, and we're being increasingly coerced.  Nobody likes being coerced.



So anyway, thank you, Frank from the Netherlands, who is using uBlock Origin more fully, and I will invite others to consider doing the same.  And Leo, we're at an hour in.  Let's take a break now.



LEO:  Okay.



STEVE:  And then I will finish up with two final pieces of feedback.



LEO:  Good thinking.  I almost stopped you, then I thought, well, no, he's put in these breaks.  He knows what he wants.  But okay, good.



STEVE:  I thought I did.



LEO:  Now back to Mr. G. and a little router discussion here.



STEVE:  Yes, two pieces of feedback from our listeners about routers.  Justin Long wrote:  "Steve, had to throw in my two cents about routers for parents:  Eero.  Full stop.  Do not pass go.  Do not collect $200.  Leo mentioned its great mesh networking capabilities, but there's one thing that makes it a perfect router for parents:  the ability to configure it without having to be at their house."



LEO:  I do that with my mom.  I can actually look at her setup.



STEVE:  Exactly.  He said:  "All Eero devices are configured via a smartphone app.  This means when you get 'the Internet stopped working' call, you can pick up your phone, which you're probably already holding, and see what's going on without having to drive to their house."



LEO:  Which is good because her house is in Rhode Island, and I'm in California.



STEVE:  She's across the country.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  "You can add multiple Eero networks to one account, so you can switch between your own network and theirs for administration.  Another benefit is Eero Plus, which is their monitoring software that blocks access to sites that host malicious content, botnets, phishing sites, et cetera.  If you have multiple networks on the same account, one Eero Plus subscription covers them all for the same price."  He said:  "Currently I have ours, my parents, and my in-laws.  Another added bonus:  There's no way for Dad to attempt to 'fix' something by blindly clicking around the router's UI.  They don't have access to it at all.  As far as they're concerned, it's just the magic box that allows them to complain about things on Facebook."



LEO:  I will add one more thing.  I don't know if you've ever used Waveform's Bufferbloat test, which is a really useful speed test I've done on all of my routers from time to time because it is really much better than a regular speed test.  It shows whether latency goes up when you're doing other things like uploading and downloading.  And but one of the things you'll find there is their recommendation for routers that don't have buffer bloat, and among others, the Netgear Nighthawk and the IQ Router and Ubiquiti EdgeRouter you've recommended so many times, the Eero Pro 6.



I think all the Eero routers are well designed, and they're also very - I think they pay a lot of attention to the latest thinking in terms of configurations and so forth.  And I think that's one of the reasons they do such a good job with buffer bloat.  So another good reason.  I think they're - we've recommended them ever since they started coming out.  And as far as I can tell, Amazon's ownership has not made them worse, it's made them better.



STEVE:  Oh, Amazon bought them.  I was wondering why you said Amazon Eero.



LEO:  Yeah.  Yeah, they bought them.



STEVE:  Oh, okay.



LEO:  Yeah, some years ago.



STEVE:  And another listener took Michael Horowitz's advice about the Peplink router.  Phil wrote:  "Hi, Steven.  I'm glad you pointed out Michael's router security website again."  Remember that was RouterSecurity.org.  He said:  "I've recently replaced my Verizon FiOS router with his recommended Peplink router, P-E-P-L-I-N-K, Peplink router, and was able to go over his shortlist, as well, and I could not be more happy.  He's even been very responsive in answering my questions that I may have had in configuring the router and anything relating to what to expect when you ditch your ISP's router.



"Not only that, but Peplink themselves have been responsive in replying to email inquiries about any issues, for which there have been none."  He said:  "When I do my monthly Tech Talk at the library where I work, one of the topics is router setup and security, and I recommend the Peplink.  Patrons will come back saying how it was pretty simple to set up, and Michael's instructions were very straightforward."  So he says:  "Thanks, Phil."



And I'll just mention that the Peplink router is what RouterSecurity site's author, Michael Horowitz, recommends.  I have no experience with it, so I can't weigh in either way, but I wanted to share Philip's positive experience and invite our listeners to consider these alternatives.  As I said on this topic earlier, unless someone deliberately chooses an insecure configuration, and with just a few tweaks, any modern consumer router should be safe, though I won't argue that security is relative.  And you can certainly spend a lot of time securing a router.  But generally what you get, unless you turn on lots of remote serving features, you're probably okay.



Okay.  So BIMI (Up Scotty), B-I-M-I.  That stands for Brand Indicators for Message Identification.  For this week's main topic, I want to share an adventure of mine from last week.  It will introduce some new email authentication technology while touching on the challenge of thwarting North Korean and AI identity spoofing and ending with the fact that several recent DDoS and network penetration attacks have left the world's Internet Archive offline; and that, as a consequence, something I was trying and hoping to do last week has been paused until the Internet Archive is back up.  And last night it seemed to be better.  This morning it was slow and sluggish.  Then later this morning it was better.



LEO:  It's been DDoSed by an ass-something.



STEVE:  Yup.



LEO:  And it is, it was supposed to be up read-only this morning, but maybe it's still having trouble.  I don't know.



STEVE:  Yeah.  And I did see that.  And in fact only the Wayback Machine portion was up in read-only.  Apparently it's able, you're able to, like, manually submit pages to it for archiving, and that feature is not currently operating.



LEO:  What kind of lowlife would attack the Internet Archive is beyond me.  It was apparently - was it Iranian hackers?  I can't - or North Korean, somebody.



STEVE:  I saw the same thing, that there was, you know, some attribution given to some, you know, something about some of the mess going on in the Middle East was supposedly behind it.  But, okay.  So this adventure began when I checked my email after last Tuesday's podcast and found a new feature notification from my favorite certificate authority, DigiCert.  It said:  "We're writing to let you know that Common Mark Certificates are now available.  Common Mark Certificates allow an organization to place a brand logo in the Sender field of outbound emails, confirming the organization's DMARC status and their authenticated identity..."



LEO:  Ah.



STEVE:  Uh-huh, "...and helping protect against phishing and spoofing attacks."  They said:  "Common Mark Certificates are similar to Verified Mark Certificates, but do not require a registered trademark for usage.  This allows a broader range of senders to add an additional layer of security to emails and help their recipients feel comfortable that the emails come from a legitimate source."



They said:  "To qualify for a Common Mark Certificate," and we've got a few bullet points.  First, "The corresponding email domain must be configured to enforce DMARC.  The corresponding brand logo must either have at least a year of previous public usage on a domain controlled by the applicant, or be an acceptable modification of a registered trademark."  And they say:  "(See Section 3.2.16 of the BIMI Group's Minimum Security Requirements for Issuance of Mark Certificates for more details.)"  And finally:  "The logo file used for the Certified Mark Certificate must be an SVG file that adheres to the SVG-P/S profile."  Then they finished, saying:  "Note:  Currently, most image editing tools do not support the SVG-P/S profile..."



LEO:  Oh, that's handy.



STEVE:  Oh, yeah, like I said, I had an adventure - "...and will require using a specific conversion tool or manually editing an SVG file."  They said:  "See our guide for properly formatting the logo."



Okay.  So first I should reiterate that BIMI is officially pronounced "Bih-mee."



LEO:  Oh, like Bimini or bikini, okay.



STEVE:  Yeah, BIMI.



LEO:  Yeah, BIMI.



STEVE:  Not "Bee-mee."  But I was unable to resist the "BIMI Up, Scotty."



LEO:  I think "BIMI Up, Scotty" is just as good.



STEVE:  It's Kirk in a hurry.  BIMI Up, Scotty.



LEO:  BIMI Up, Scotty.



STEVE:  You know?  Because we've lost a bunch of red shirts, and we're about to go, too.



LEO:  Whoa, boy.  Get me out of here.



STEVE:  So you know how that goes.  Okay.  So BIMI, as I said, is the abbreviation for Brand Indicators for Message Identification.  It is a new - relatively, we'll see it's been around for, they've been working on it for 10 years - and slowly, as in very slowly, emerging email standard that creates - what's interesting here is a secure means for incoming email to carry and display its sender's unspoofable logo icon.  Email clients and online services that choose to support BIMI will be able to display these logos, and will only display these logos, if and when the email's senders have jumped through quite a large number of hoops to make that possible.



This is all being managed by an industry BIMI working group at BIMIGroup.org, B-I-M-I-G-R-O-U-P dot org.  The members of this group are Fastmail, Google, Mailchimp, Proofpoint, SendGrid, Validity, Valimail and Yahoo!.  The project began, as I said, a full 10 years ago, back in 2014.  And today the display of BIMI logo icons is supported by Apple, Cloudmark, Fastmail, Google, Yahoo!, and Zoho.



LEO:  I want to do this.  We have a trademark.



STEVE:  Yes, you do.



LEO:  On our TWiT logo.



STEVE:  Yes, you do.



LEO:  Yeah.



STEVE:  So what this group has managed to design and achieve, finally, wide consensus on is the rough equivalent of the web server TLS certificates we rely heavily on to prevent interception and spoofing of the domains our web browsers visit.  This BIMI system provides a means for senders who care to, to strongly authenticate that they are the sender of their email.



I don't have to tell anyone that email is a mess.  Whether one is on the sending or the receiving end, everyone knows this.  Yet everyone needs email.  It is, as we know, the Internet's lowest common denominator for communication.  As we've observed here, we could not have usernames and passwords without email because no other authentication system is viable without some reliable backup lowest common denominator fallback means for ultimately authenticating users when they forget their password or don't have their second factor authenticator handy or whatever.  It always comes down to email.



So for the past decade an effort has been underway to allow email senders who choose to, and email services who choose to, to display strongly authenticated visual graphic logos in email recipients' inboxes.  And I have a picture in the show notes showing what you normally see.  It shows MailTimer, and so there's just a generic M in a circle, and Email Marketing News, an E in a circle, as opposed to their actual logos, which the email client is able to show.  And I confirm that my iOS devices are showing those where they're in use.



LEO:  Now, if I - okay.  So I have my picture as a Gravatar.  And most email clients will pick that up as the icon and put it next to the email.  How can I distinguish a BIMI official trademark from a Gravatar, which anybody could do?



STEVE:  Yup, that's a good - that is a good point.  A Gravatar, if it is available, or if you have a photo associated with a person's contact name.



LEO:  Right.  On Apple, if it's in the contacts; that's right.



STEVE:  Right.  Yeah.  So we are seeing, you know, some collision here.



LEO:  It's kind of a flimsy authentication method.  Is that all there is, the icon on the email?



STEVE:  Yes.  That's what this is for.



LEO:  Okay.  All right.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  I mean, I use PGP authentication that not only verifies that I am the sender, but that the message is unmodified.



STEVE:  But nobody knows how to receive that.



LEO:  Nobody knows what to do with it.  But it's there.



STEVE:  Right.



LEO:  You could use S/MIME certificates to do that.  Nobody knows how to use that, either.



STEVE:  Yeah.  So what I want is when GRC's email comes, people will see that Ruby G logo that I've been using for 40 years, since before the Internet existed.



LEO:  Right.



STEVE:  And, you know, and make no mistake, this has been slow to catch on.  For one thing, as I'll explain in a minute, it's a serious pain in the butt, it's almost comical, for the sender to get it working.  And it's not for end users, it's intended specifically for use by bulk email senders.  It's also not free, since it requires the use of an annually expiring certificate behind which is some truly world-class authentication.



But I would argue that, for this purpose, "not being free" is a benefit, since the entire reason the world is being buried in unwanted email is that it costs nothing to send.  And even in a world with high BIMI adoption, email will still cost nothing to send.  But only those senders who are willing to spend some money and take the time and trouble will be able to embellish their incoming email with their company's unspoofable brand logo.  And Leo, for what it's worth, if this becomes adopted and becomes valuable, then Apple could, for example, could certainly choose to further enhance...



LEO:  Sure, somehow put a key on it or something that says "This is not a Gravatar," right.



STEVE:  Right.  Exactly.  This is an authenticated piece of email.  Okay.  So for bulk mail senders, and even for me, I want that G to show up, it'll likely be worth something.  So how does all this new stuff work?  The first gating requirement for any possible display of a BIMI logo is that the sender's email passes "DMARC" validation.  Okay.  So let's briefly review these three email standards, which are all part of this:  SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.



SPF, which stands for Sender Policy Framework.  It uses additional records in the apparent sending domain's DNS to indicate which IP addresses are valid originators of that domain's email.  Since email is sent using the SMTP protocol over TCP, the IP addresses of the endpoints cannot be spoofed.  So when a remote sending email server connects to a receiving server, the receiving server obtains the unspoofable IP address of the sending server.  Then, when the recipient receives an email claiming to be from a specific domain, the receiving server can issue a DNS query on the spot to request that originating domain's SPF records, if any.



Those SPF records will specify which IP addresses are authentic senders for that domain.  So if the IP of the sender of the incoming email for that domain is not authorized by the domain's SPF records, the connection will be dropped, and the email will not be accepted.  This costs nothing to do, and it very nicely prevents spammers from spoofing the domains of valid senders.



For example, I have an SPF record for GRC.  It uses GRC's DNS to publish the IP address of GRC's email server.  So when a random spammer generates email claiming to be from the GRC.com domain, any receiver of that email is able to check the sender's IP, see that it's not coming from the one IP allowed by GRC, and to then ignore the email.  Note that SPF has no way of preventing the attempt to spoof an email's origin, but it does provide a zero-cost means for a recipient to confirm the validity of the originator.  And you can believe that Apple and Outlook and Google and Yahoo! and everybody, they're using this because they want to block all of this that they can.



While SPF identifies the authorized sender by IP address, it does not protect the integrity of the email itself.  It offers no protection against anything that might alter the email's contents in transit.  For that we have DKIM, D-K-I-M, which stands for DomainKeys Identified Mail.  DKIM allows sending email servers to digitally sign the email envelope headers their outgoing email has so that the receiving server is able to verify that signature.  And once again we have another use for DNS where additional DKIM records in the server's DNS domain are used to publish the public key with which its DKIM-signed email envelope headers can be verified.  The receiving server sees the claimed FROM domain, queries that domain's DNS for its DKIM public key, then uses that key to verify the signature contained within the incoming email.



The final piece of this triumvirate is DMARC, Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance, D-M-A-R-C.  DMARC is a policy which is also published in the sending domain's DNS.  It allows the sender's domain to indicate whether their email messages ARE protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and this DMARC policy instructs a recipient what to do if either of those authentication methods, which the site says must be enforced, fails.  Do they reject the message, or quarantine it, or send back a report, or what?



So a crucial thing to appreciate is that, even today, all of these layers of email integrity and anti-domain-spoofing are completely optional.  There is no need for any of them to be present or applied.  They benefit the sender by preventing the sending domain's reputation from being abused, and they benefit the receiver by providing a means by which the true sender of any DMARC-protected email can be verified.  But all of this only works if both ends play.  If the sender doesn't take advantage of these tools, or if the recipient doesn't bother to check against them, then neither end gets any benefit.



The other factor here is that all of this happens down in the plumbing of the Internet's SMTP protocol.  None of this is ever seen by any of the eventual recipients of the email.  There's never been any obvious visual indication of whether or not any of these various tests pass or fail, until now.  One of the key requirements for any display of a BIMI logo is that the sender's DMARC policy must pass, which in turn requires SPF and DKIM to be present and to both succeed.  So the first thing BIMI's display will mean in the real world is that the email actually originated from the claimed sender.



And this brings us to the logo itself and the question of how BIMI avoids the unauthorized or fraudulent use of organization logos.  What, for example, prevents somebody else from copying GRC's Ruby G logo and using it for themselves?  To answer that question, let's see what the BIMI group themselves have to say.



In their FAQ for this, they write:  "Verifying a logo is authorized for use by a specific domain has been at the center of the debate since the idea for BIMI was first discussed.  In fact, that very issue is why it has taken the past seven years to develop the specification."



LEO:  I should point out, by the way, that DKIM, SPF, and DMARC are often now supported.  For instance, Gmail will reject mail that isn't properly signed.



STEVE:  Right.



LEO:  So that's the good news, right, that the things are getting better, at least in that regard.



STEVE:  Maybe.  Google's policy is that, if you send more than 5,000 pieces of email a day, then you have to have DMARC.



LEO:  Ah, okay.  But I'm talking about inbound.  I think that you have a good chance of getting blackholed if you are not - Google said they were going to require DMARC.  But I might be mistaken on that.



STEVE:  The problem is there are still too many servers out there that do not support it.



LEO:  Right, right.



STEVE:  And they want to be able to send email to Gmail people because that's about half of the world.  So, yeah.  But bulk mail senders sending more than 5,000 pieces of mail a day, Google will say...



LEO:  Ah, you're right, it says bulk.  Google and Yahoo! announced requirements that bulk senders must have DMARC in place.  Yeah, yeah.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  Oh, I misread that.  I thought it was everybody.  But you're right.  So few people have that.



STEVE:  Right.  So one of the cool things about this, and again, anyone who - any email supplier like Apple or Google or whomever who chose to could use BIMI to create a stronger indication that authentication was in place because that would be nice to know.  So anyway, they said this issue has taken seven years to develop, and this thing I'm reading was written in 2021.  So it's been 10 years.



LEO:  Oh, my god.



STEVE:  They said:  "Since this was such a difficult problem to solve, we developed two different types of BIMI records to get where we are today.  Self-Asserted Records," they said, "In the first case, there is no verification of the logo at all.  It was left up to the mailbox providers to decide whether or not to display the logo."  And I should just mention nobody does because it doesn't provide what BIMI wants to provide.  The second is:  "Records with Evidence Documents.  As many pointed out, there needed to be some form of evaluation such that a logo could be verified as being authorized for use by a domain."



So they said:  "Up until recently, the most broadly deployed BIMI records were 'self-asserted.'  Only a couple of mailbox providers accepted them, and those that did (for example Yahoo!) carefully considered which domains they allowed to display logos.  Then on July 12th Gmail announced support for BIMI which required an evidence document in the form of a Verified Mark Certificate.  In order to obtain a Verified Mark Certificate, a company must provide evidence that their logo is a registered trademark, i.e., that a government agency recognizes its legitimate use.  The VMC also attests to the use of that logo in relation to identified domains.  Mailbox providers can now retrieve and verify the VMC to ensure that the logo is authorized for use by that domain."  And I'll note that they've actually softened this a bit for that Common Mark.  The Common Mark Certificate just requires that you can demonstrate at least a year's worth of use of that logo on your domain.



So they finish:  "Regardless of which BIMI record is used, the situation collapses into a single requirement:  reputational trust.  While a self-asserted record requires that the mailbox provider trusts the domain, for example, relying on their own reputation about the domain, a VMC moves the trust model from the domain to the VMC issuer."  And so now we're talking certificates, and now we're talking certificate authorities, which is why DigiCert got into the game.  In other words, we introduce the classic concept of a certificate authority.  We trust the certificate authority, so we trust the CA's identify assertions by extension.



Now they have an FAQ.  They said:  "At this time, there are two Certificate Authorities that are accepted as Mark Verifying Authorities (MVAs) who can issue VMCs for use with BIMI."  And get this, Leo, DigiCert and Entrust.  And, yes, it's that Entrust.



LEO:  How did that happen?  



STEVE:  The Entrust from whom Chrome will no longer trust certificates...



LEO:  That's crazy.



STEVE:  ...signed after the end of this month.  And, by the way, Mozilla has made the same decision, ending their new certificate trust of Entrust one month later, at the end of November.  Now, I don't know whether Entrust's hack to become a certificate intermediary would work here, and I don't care, because GRC's BIMI certificate, if I'm ever able to get one, will certainly be signed by DigiCert.  More on that in a minute.



The BIMI FAQ continues:  "So," they said, "it's essentially the job of the MVA (Mark Verifying Authority) to verify that the logos are authorized for use with BIMI.  Then it's up to the mailbox providers to decide what MVAs they trust to issue VMCs (Verified Mark Certificates)."  And believe me, if everyone does what DigiCert does, it'll be a cold day in Arizona before any spammer is using GRC's logo.  Okay.  I'll explain in a second.



They said:  "And if you're curious about the steps the MVAs perform when evaluating a request for a VMC, here's the current process the CAs are following."  And then they provide the VMC_Guidelines_latest.pdf.  Now, they said:  "If you've gone through the entire 94 pages, congratulations, it's pretty dense."  And actually today it's 129 pages.



LEO:  Oh, wow.



STEVE:  So they said:  "You'll see that the evaluation process is reasonably thorough.  The CAs are trying very hard to ensure that their VMCs can be trusted.  As a checksum, if the email security community finds the CA has improperly issued a VMC, mailbox providers will no longer accept VMCs provided from that CA, which would essentially neutralize the CA's VMC business."  So maybe Entrust shouldn't even bother.



Okay.  So I know that listeners to this podcast would find it interesting to see GRC's "Ruby G" logo appear in the sender field of their email client when, for example, they open email from me in Gmail or Yahoo! or Apple.  And if the presence of a BIMI logo, and everything that went into obtaining one, lent more credibility to GRC's email and helped them to be routed not to spam or junk folders, then I would regard that as time well invested.  And in fact, that's the other thing that is expected is that BIMI-signed email will have a stronger reputation out of the gate.



So last week, after seeing that email from DigiCert, I headed over to their site to see what I needed to do.  On the "Request Verified Mark Certificate" page, the first thing that's needed is to create the logo.  You've got to create it and upload it for them to approve.  But as I mentioned before, the uploaded format is quite specific and not readily created.  In this day and age of widely varying device resolution, it makes sense for anything being newly defined to finally drop "pixels" and "resolution" in favor of "vectors."  Vectors are the only way to go for the future, and the world figured that out in the case of fonts a long time ago.



So the BIMI specification nominally uses the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) standard.  But they really wanted to get this right, which creates a few roadblocks since pretty much nothing currently supports the new deliberately constrained standard that they defined.  On their "Solving SVG Issues" page, they wrote:  "There are many reasons why your SVG might fail one of the online BIMI validators, and many of these issues stem from the requirement that all SVG images conform to the Tiny Portable Secure (Tiny-PS) standard."  Huh?



They said:  "The SVG Tiny-PS (where PS stands for Portable/Secure) is a streamlined profile of the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) specification, designed to provide a lightweight, secure, and portable solution for displaying vector graphics, particularly in environments with resource constraints.  It retains the core functionality necessary for rendering scalable images while eliminating more complex features that may pose security risks or require extensive processing power.  Its simplicity and focus on security ensure that graphics are rendered consistently and safely across diverse platforms.  When updating an SVG file to comply with the SVG Tiny-PS standard, additional considerations include ensuring device compatibility, maintaining performance efficiency, and adhering to the standard's limitations.  SVG Tiny-PS supports a limited subset of SVG elements and attributes."



And I can attest to that.  Basically the SVG standard grew over  time, as all standards of this sort do, to include all kinds of superfluous crap.  In fact, you can even put a bitmap in an SVG, even though that's contrary to the SVG concept.  But of course.  So what they've done is they've stripped it back to the things you really need.  You know, curves and rectangles and circles and filled patterns and gradients and things.  So you could do what you need.  You just can't dump anything in.  So it ends up being constrained.



I think it's entirely reasonable, but it does introduce a hurdle.  After searching around the Internet, the only tool I could find that would export an SVG file in what's known as the  "Tiny v1.2" format was Adobe Illustrator.  And having been an early fan of PaintShop Pro and Corel Draw, I've never been over in Adobe's camp.  But I discovered that Illustrator is available with a seven-day free trial, you don't need a credit card or anything, it'll stop working after seven days, so I installed it.  I converted my simple "Ruby G" bitmap from raster to vector and then used an Illustrator script which I found over on DigiCert's BIMI help page to export a fully compliant SVG Tiny-PS format.  I then uploaded that to DigiCert, who inspected the file and approved it for BIMI's use.  So now what?  It turned out that was the easy part.  I'll explain what happened next.



LEO:  Oh, boy.



STEVE:  That was the easy part.  Then we start having to prove things.



LEO:  Oh, boy.



STEVE:  So let's take our last break, Leo, and then the fun begins.



LEO:  Wow.  What fun this is down the BIMI trail.  Okay.



STEVE:  Yeah.  BIMI up, Scotty.



LEO:  BIMI up, Scotty.  All right.  And you know that no normal human is going to know anything about this, or whether it exists or anything.  So, well, our audience will, so that's good.



STEVE:  Before a would-be BIMI user even begins the process, it's necessary for the organization to be certified at the EV level.  Remember EVs?  Those Extended Validation certificates that fell out of favor when web browsers decided to stop showing extra fields of green for EV certificate sites because end-users didn't ever really understand what was going on, to your point, Leo, about the BIMI logos.  Maybe we won't ever understand.  Or maybe they'll be given special treatment once they, you know, achieve critical mass.  Who knows?



And also, since nothing prevented typo-squatting sites from obtaining their own EV certificates, that was really the death knell because typo-squatters were able to get EV certs on their mistyped domain names, so users saw that and said, oh, look, it's all green.  It must be safe.  No.  So even though EV certificates are not coming back, the level of organizational validation they once required is still going strong.



What this essentially means is that any organization displaying a BIMI mark in their email will have been validated at the same level as is required for EV certification.  In this case, it means that I had to have Sue standing by at our corporate landline when someone from DigiCert called the phone number that an organization such as Dun & Bradstreet has listed in their corporate records for Gibson Research Corporation.  Sue answered DigiCert's call and verified a bunch of information about our company and our website.  She also confirmed that I, Steve Gibson, would be serving as DigiCert's "Verified Contact" for this "Verified Mark Certificate" order, and that I was authorized to request and have a Verified Mark Certificate generated.



LEO:  Do you get a special hat?



STEVE:  No.  But I got a special phone call.  Once that was done, I received an email explaining what my role would be.  I first needed to take photos of the front and back of an officially issued U.S. government photo ID and securely upload them to DigiCert through their SharePoint 365 account.  Now, what might once have seemed intrusive is no longer any big deal since, after all, National Public Data has already posted all of that stuff publicly.



LEO:  Everybody's got that.



STEVE:  It's all out there already, so who cares?  On the other hand, couldn't all of that public data now be used to convincingly spoof an uploaded identity?  Maybe, but DigiCert thought of that, too.  The next step was to use an online scheduling app to arrange an interview, first by phone and then by online Zoom video conference.



LEO:  Oh, my god.



STEVE:  Using the scheduling app, I booked the first available 30-minute slot.  And at the appointed time I received a phone call from a DigiCert person.  He identified himself as the person I'd been corresponding with, and he instructed me to please upload photos of my ID to their SharePoint 365 account.  I told him that I had already followed the link in the earlier email and done so.  He thanked me and asked if I was ready to switch to Zoom.  I told him I was, so he sent me a Zoom link.



Clicking the link brought me into a two-way audio conference with a one-way video.  His camera was never enabled, so I only saw his name, but he had a clear view of me, just like our listeners do right now because I used our same system.



LEO:  Yes.



STEVE:  He had told me that I would need to show the same ID during the video conference.  So I went back, got it out of my wallet, and I had it handy.  He first asked me to pose on camera so he could capture that.  Then he asked me to hold the ID up next to my head...



LEO:  Oh, my god.



STEVE:  ...so that both my face and my ID were on camera side-by-side at the same time.  I did that.



LEO:  This is more than you had to do for an EV cert.



STEVE:  Oh, yeah.  EV, we left off on Sue telling the guy to have a nice day.



LEO:  Yeah.  Wow.



STEVE:  So then he asked me, while still holding the ID up next to my head, to pass my other free hand across my face and then both in front of and behind my ID, while still holding it relatively motionless.



LEO:  Oh, my god.



STEVE:  It took a bit of finagling to satisfy him.  But since I was neither an AI-generated spoof nor a North Korean posing as some old white guy, I was able to follow his instructions and satisfy him that I was indeed me.



LEO:  Wow.



STEVE:  And, since this created an unbroken trust chain from GRC's public corporate records, through our offices, to me and my identity, this was able to satisfy their need to confirm the authenticity of our logo submission.  I forgot to mention that earlier in the process, after I had successfully created and uploaded and verified the Tiny v1.2-P/S SVG logo file, DigiCert's website had required me to post a specific text string in GRC's DNS and then click "OK" once I had so that I could prove ownership over the GRC.com domain.



And this brings us to the final step where they verify that I've been using that logo on GRC's website for at least a year.  Since I've been using it for the past 40 years, since before the web came into existence, from the moment it came into existence and every day thereafter, I figured this final step would be a slam dunk.  So how do you imagine they verify my longstanding use of this logo?



LEO:  Oh, no.



STEVE:  Oh, yes.  They use the famous "Wayback Machine"...



LEO:  Oh, no.



STEVE:  ...at The Internet Archive over at Archive.org.



LEO:  I was wondering what the connection was.



STEVE:  However, there was a slight glitch last week, since for most of last week and all of the weekend and apparently until sometime yesterday, all of The Internet Archive was under attack and offline.



LEO:  They were trying to keep you from getting your BIMI.  Now we know why.



STEVE:  And as a consequence of that, after everything I had gone through, the final step in the long process of obtaining a BIMI certificate has been placed on hold.



LEO:  Oh, my god.  The weakest link.  Oh, my god.



STEVE:  Now, that's fine with me since GRC obtaining this certification is certainly not an emergency.  So whenever it manages to happen will be fine with me.  Probably, you know, later this week.  All of the required steps have been taken on my end.  So once DigiCert is able to look back in time at GRC's historic use of that logo, which they will see on every single page that the Wayback Machine has ever indexed...



LEO:  Wait a minute.  What if you weren't on the Internet Wayback Machine?  Not everything is; right?



STEVE:  That's true.



LEO:  The heck?  That seems very...



STEVE:  In that case you could, if your logo was registered, then you would be in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Register.



LEO:  Our logo's - your logo's not registered?



STEVE:  I never bothered to register the logo.  Yes.



LEO:  So that's why.  Because ours is - this logo is in the trademark.



STEVE:  Yup.  And if you've got that trademarked, then no problem.



LEO:  It's a service mark or whatever it is, yeah.



STEVE:  Right.  Okay.  So what happened was that a series of DDoS attacks began last Tuesday, October 8th.  And somehow mixed in with that was a JavaScript library-based site defacement which affected the Internet Archive, and a breach which leaked usernames and email addresses and salted hashed passwords for 31 million past Internet Archive users.  The Archive's greatest concern was the preservation of the integrity of their archive, so they took everything offline while they worked to figure out exactly what had happened.



Wikipedia informs us that Brewster Kahle is an American digital librarian, computer engineer, Internet entrepreneur, and advocate of universal access to all knowledge.  In 1982 he graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from MIT, and in 1996 Kahle founded the Internet Archive.  In 2012, he was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame.



LEO:  And a year later he was on Triangulation, if you ever want to see an interview with him.  Quite - I love Brewster Kahle.  Amazing fellow.



STEVE:  Yup.  He seems like 100% good, you know, he's like what we wish we had more of.



LEO:  I agree, yeah.



STEVE:  So Archive.org has a Mastodon instance, and Brewster has posted two updates there.  His first one said:  "What we know:  DDoS attack fended off for now; defacement of our website via JS library; breach of usernames/email/salted-encrypted passwords.  What we've done:  Disabled the JS library, scrubbing systems, upgrading security.  Will share more as we know it."



And then he said a little bit later:  "Sorry, but DDoS folks are back and knocked Archive.org and OpenLibrary.org offline.  @InternetArchive is being cautious and prioritizing keeping data safe at the expense of service availability.  Will share more as we know it."



So as I said, I checked this morning, and I saw - I checked this morning online and saw a raft of articles about this.  You know, headlines read, from BleepingComputer:  "Internet Archive hacked, data breach impacts 31 million users."  Forbes wrote:  "Internet History Hacked, Wayback Machine Down, 31 Million Passwords Stolen."  The Verge wrote:  "The Internet Archive is still down, but will return in days, not weeks."  That's something that Brewster posted elsewhere.  CyberNews said:  "Internet Archive down after two-day DDoS attack, user info compromised."  And Fast Company more recently said:  "The Internet Archive is back online after a cyberattack."



So I've observed some of the Internet dialogue surrounding this event, and this interruption in the availability of the Internet's Archive has served a useful purpose, I think.  It has served to remind people just how important this service has become.  It's one of those things that's easily taken for granted until it's not available, at which point you realize just how important it can be to have a "Wayback Machine" that allows us to view earlier states of the Internet.



Our listeners may recall that I put the Archive's Wayback Machine to extensive use back when we were examining the effects of that Polyfill.io trouble, where we looked at the danger of a publisher of a widely used and publicly hosted JavaScript library turning control over to another entity.  I needed to look back in time to see how the Polyfill.io site had grown and evolved since its earliest days, and this research was only possible because the Wayback Machine had been quietly, dutifully, and continuously taking and storing snapshots of the Polyfill.io site - along with all the other sites that it crawls on the Internet - throughout its entire life.



The Verge's most recent reporting said this.  They said:  "The Internet Archive is back online in a read-only state after a cyberattack brought down the digital library and Wayback Machine last week.  A data breach and DDoS attack kicked the site offline on October 9th, with a user authentication database containing 31 million unique records stolen in recent weeks.  The Internet Archive is now back online in a 'provisional, read-only manner,' according to founder Brewster Kahle, 'safe to resume, but might need further maintenance, in which case it will be suspended again.'"



And they wrote:  "While you can access the Wayback Machine to search 916 billion web pages that have been archived over time, you cannot currently capture an existing web page into the archive.  Kahle and team have gradually been restoring Archive.org services in recent days, including bringing back the team's email accounts and its crawlers for National Libraries.  Services have been offline so that Internet Archive staff can examine and strengthen them against future attacks.



"A pop-up from a purported hacker claimed the archive had suffered a 'catastrophic security breach' last week, before Have I Been Pwned confirmed the data was stolen.  The theft included email addresses, screen names, hashed passwords, and other internal data for 31 million unique email accounts.



"The Internet Archive outage came just weeks after Google started adding links to archived websites in the Wayback Machine.  Google removed its own cached page links earlier this year, so having the Wayback Machine linked in Google search results is a useful way to access older versions of websites or archived pages."  Okay.  So...



LEO:  This would be a good opportunity, by the way, for people to donate to the Internet Archive.  I'm a longtime supporter.  I give them money every month.



STEVE:  As am I, yup.



LEO:  Yeah.  This is such an important - more than a service, this is an important way to back up our history.



STEVE:  Yes, yes.



LEO:  And it's got to be supported.



STEVE:  And I don't know if an organization like Cloudflare might be interested in being a benefactor here, nor what Brewster's requirements would be.  They might be in collision.  Or even if it's, you know, even feasible.  But the Internet Archive, Leo, as you said, it's a vital tool for researchers, academics, and others.  And I suspect that its value and importance will only increase over time.



In any event, it now appears that the Wayback Machine is limping back online, and that before long DigiCert will say that they have been able to use the Wayback machine to verify my decades-long use of that "G" logo.  At that point they will approve and issue a BIMI certificate that will be valid for any newly minted certificate's maximum life of 398 days.  They seem eager to host the logo and the certificate from their servers.  You can do it yourself, but they're volunteering.  So I'm fine with that.  It seems to me that they'll provide the URLs, and it might add a little more credibility to it that it's coming from DigiCert.com.



So whenever a BIMI-supporting email provider receives email from GRC - as Apple will, Gmail will, Yahoo! will and so forth - in addition to verifying that email's authenticity by pulling our SPF, DKIM, and DMARC DNS records, they'll proactively check for and pull GRC's BIMI record.  That will provide two URLs.  It will tell them where to obtain the "Ruby G" SVG logo itself, and where to find its validating certificate.  I haven't looked into how the logo and the certificate are related, but since it's possible for me to host those files myself, they must be protected from tampering.  Assuming that the SVG file itself is not altered, the certificate probably contains a hash of the approved SVG logo file and an indication of the domain for which the logo is valid.



So anyone wishing to support BIMI logo-embellishment on their mailboxes could look up the information, hash the SVG logo they retrieve, and check for the matching hash inside its matching BIMI certificate.  Since the certificate would be signed by DigiCert's trusted root, this would establish a chain of trust sufficient to authenticate the logo's use for the indicated email domain.  And the email provider could then confidently show that logo to its email users, but only if the email also passes DMARC validation.  So it's the first visible indication we've had on the Internet of email authenticity in the guise of a logo provided by the email sender.



Now, for GRC, as I've said, that did not happen in time for this week's podcast mailing to the Security Now! subscribers, which went out this morning.  But having jumped through, as I said, through all those hoops to get this far, and with us now only waiting for the Wayback Machine to be available to allow GRC's historical logo usage to be confirmed, I'm hopeful that everyone may see it in their mail next week.  So that'll be an interesting change.



Upon learning that Gmail had adopted BIMI support some time ago, I went poking around in my own Gmail inbox.  Though I did not dig too deeply - and again, I don't get lots of valid email there, it is my throwaway email account - I did see that PayPal and Disney+ both had BIMI logos for their email.  So BIMI logo usage is around; but we're certainly, you know, not seeing it in common use.  Will it become more common over time?  It's too soon to tell.



Since email providers have total freedom to decide which Certificate Authority's Verified Mark Certificates they wish to support, and having seen the costly rigor DigiCert just applied to me to prevent any form of spoofing, it's clear that if the BIMI group could be accused of anything, it would be setting the bar for this too high.  But in an industry that has repeatedly been in such a hurry that the bar is usually set too low, I consider this to be a change in the right direction.  Though obtaining this level of identity proof is difficult and costly, any organization that does this gets a year of extra strong identity for their email, if anyone notices or understands.



At this point I'm pretty certain that most users have no idea that any of this is going on.  I certainly didn't until I dug into this.  But if it catches on, it might begin to chip away at some of the catastrophe that completely free email creation and delivery has created.  And it only costs something to the sender who's decided that they care enough to super-authenticate the sending of their email to its recipients.  So that's BIMI.



LEO:  Couple of questions.  One, doesn't an EV cert cost quite a bit of money?



STEVE:  Yeah.  They are not cheap.



LEO:  Okay.  Like thousands of dollars a year.



STEVE:  I don't think it's that much.



LEO:  It's not that much.  Okay.



STEVE:  I think that's a multiyear with an annual renewal.



LEO:  But you can't get multiyear renewal anymore.  So, yeah, okay, maybe it's not that expensive.  But it's expensive.  It's not trivial to get it.  It's interesting that it's required.  Is that just a DigiCert requirement?  Or is that a BIMI requirement?



STEVE:  That's a good question.  And as I said, I did not look through that 127-page document...



LEO:  I don't blame you.



STEVE:  ...on its requirements.  But what is required is that is EV level certification.



LEO:  Right.  That makes sense.



STEVE:  So I didn't actually get an EV cert.  I didn't mean to imply that I got an EV cert.



LEO:  Oh.



STEVE:  But EV-level certification...



LEO:  Oh, you don't have to have an EV cert.  You just...



STEVE:  No.



LEO:  Oh, oh, oh.  You were just saying it's the same level.  I misunderstood.



STEVE:  Right.  It's EV-style certification where, I mean, so...



LEO:  They call and all that.



STEVE:  Yeah.  Back when we were doing EV certs, Sue had to do the same thing.  She had to be standing by when the phone rang and answer it, you know, and say...



LEO:  Yeah, we did the same thing, yeah.



STEVE:  Yeah.  Yeah.



LEO:  And any company would be able to, you know, jump through these hoops.



STEVE:  Oh, yeah, PayPal's got, you know, they pay people to stand around.



LEO:  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  That'll be interesting, to see if this catches on.  I feel like it doesn't really go the full distance.  And of course you've got to get all the email clients to display it.



STEVE:  True.  True.



LEO:  I was just looking at Fastmail.  I don't see any provision in Fastmail to display BIMI logos.  Obviously Gmail does.



STEVE:  Fastmail, I named them.  Either they're...



LEO:  They're on the group.  They're in the group.  That's why I was surprised.



STEVE:  So are they in the group that were supporting it or were displaying it?



LEO:  They were in the initial team putting it together.



STEVE:  Ah, okay.  So...



LEO:  But whether they, I mean, maybe they do.  Just was a cursory search.



STEVE:  So you should, if you have PayPal or Disney+, those are the only two that I know of.



LEO:  I have a PayPal, dedicated PayPal folder.  Let me...



STEVE:  And maybe, if this works by next week, you'll be able to look at my mail.



LEO:  That would be so cool.



STEVE:  Yeah.



LEO:  Yeah.  I would like that.  Oh, well.  Yeah, I don't see any...



STEVE:  I'm going to do it, and our listeners who receive email from me will, I mean, like anytime you get email from GRC it'll then have - it'll be embellished with that Ruby G logo.  



LEO:  Yeah.  I'm looking at PayPal emails, and I don't see any logos.  The other question was...



STEVE:  It's got their little double P leaning is the logo.



LEO:  Yeah.  And that's presumably stored, not by PayPal; right?



STEVE:  It is, well, PayPal could source it, or DigiCert could source it.



LEO:  See, I don't like it if PayPal sources it because then that's a tracking pixel.



STEVE:  Oh, if it's not embedded, you're right.  No, well, no.  Because Google, for example, would download one copy of it and then would cache it locally.



LEO:  It would use it everywhere, cache it, okay.



STEVE:  Right.



LEO:  That's fine.  I would just - I could see PayPal going, oh, good, one more way to...



STEVE:  Yeah.  So it's not the email client that reaches out and fetches it.  It is the email provider...



LEO:  It's a server.



STEVE:  ...that is only if the email passes DMARC and you have matching certificate for the logo.  Then the email provider adds that to your inbox.



LEO:  I don't mind the idea.  We'll see what happens.  I'll look forward to seeing a Ruby G in my email from that.  Make it a lot easier to find you.



STEVE:  Yay.



LEO:  In that pile of trash I call "my email."  Steve Gibson is at GRC.com.  You know what that stands for?  Gibson Research Corporation.  That's where he does his work.
